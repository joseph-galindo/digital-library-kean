# Digital Kean Library - Historical Google Mapping

This is some legacy code from a project I worked on from 2014-2015 as part of my senior capstone project at Kean University.

It is admittedly a bit of spaghetti code, although I have learned quite a lot since then and probably wouldn't write it this way if I were to re-do this whole project. However, I wanted this on github as part of my history and also as a reminder of how things can be structured better.

__Info__

This was a joint effort between Kean's Computer Science Department and History Department. The History Department had come across several hundred WWII-era records that they wanted to share with the world, and they came to the conclusion of creating a website to archive the records. That's what this project's focus was.

The project is a simple website allowing you to search against records, view record transcripts and images, and also to view paths of the people that created the records via a simple mapping through the Google Maps API. 

It was a very ambitious project given my experience at the time, but I learned several important things about frontend dev through doing this.

The MySQL database used in this project is not currently hosted by me, but by a machine physically located on Kean University's campus. In the interest of not destroying a generous professor's miniserver, I've removed the database credential info from this project. However, if you're interested in seeing this project actually working, you can find that over [here](http://eve.kean.edu/~jrgalind/).
