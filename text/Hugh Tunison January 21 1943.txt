Dear Miss Thompson,

My battalion has been skipping around the country so much since Christmas time that I haven't had time to write.

While the college was closed for Christmas vacation we returned home for our short 5 day furlough. I enjoyed the visit thoroughly but I would have enjoyed visiting you, too. The picture you requested when I last saw you, I think I can get from my folks since they snapped one of me in the Navy uniform, complete with peacoat & flat-top or "micky mouse" hat.

A day or so ago we were issued special actic clothing. (I'm sorry I can't get a picture of that outfit.) And now, our train is taking us north, out of sunny California and into the snow at Seattle. From there we may shove off for the far north. Of course, clothing now [illegible], is not a good indicator for an ultimate destination yet it gives us something to think & talk about. The outfit consists of sheepskin coat, special arctic suit overshoes, face mask, two helmets similar to our aviator's, mittens, heavy Red Cross sweaters, heavy underwear & sox, and so on. Of course they also gave us gas masks & they will issue many other things here at Seattle. We service men realize how costly a war can be.

By the way, your "Servicemen's News" is a really worthwhile [illegible]. I Enjoyed the first edition & hope that you will send me future editions.

Sincerely

Hugh
