Dear Miss Thompson: - 

May I apologize for being so long in answering you? I wanted to contact Jack by mail first.

Jack is doing a wonderful job up to the present. It is very hard and exacting.

Upon completion of his [illegible] at College in Reading Pa. he was sent to Nashville Tenn Classification Center. After 5 weeks of every type of test he passed high for Pilot, Navigator or Bombadier. Jack chose Pilot. He had 9 weeks at Maxwell Field as a Cadet. and passed again one of the top men. He is now flying solo at Carlstrom Field Arcadia Florida.

I know any word from the college will be greatfully received, as he does get a little homesick at times.

I am also enclosing an announcement of his engagement. 

Thank you for contacting me, I remain,

Sincerely

(Mrs.) Leonona F. Keefe
