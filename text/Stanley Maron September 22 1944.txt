Dear Miss Thompson,
	It seems as though it were only yesterday that I was in visiting you on my furlough, and now I find myself many miles away in a foreign land.
	Our trip across was very pleasant, with remarkably good weather. I was even able to get in a snatch of England passing by the window of our train car.
	France has a beauty that war could never mar. The houses and the countryside are just as would be pictured.
                                                                       			Stan
