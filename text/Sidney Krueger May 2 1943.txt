DEAR MISS THOMPSON,

THAT SUPER DUPER, NEWSY LETTER YOU SENT ME CERTAINLY WAS WELCOME. THANKS LOADS. WHEN FAMILIAR NAMES ARE MENTIONED WITH THE DETAIL YOU USED, IT SEEMS AS THOUGH ONE IS REALLY NO SO FAR AWAY. THAT'S WHY WE ALL CLAMOR FOR LETTERS SO PERSISTENTLY.

I COULDN'T IMAGINE WHO HAD WRITTEN TO ME AS P.F.C.S. KRUEGER. I'M STILL AT THE BOTTOM OF THE LADDER. ONLY BECAUSE THE ARMY, LIKE SO MANY OTHER BUSINESS CONCERNS, PROMOTIONS ENTAIL RED TAPE PLUS OTHER ANNOYING THINGS WHICH I'D RATHER NOT TALK ABOUT. THE BOYS IN MY OFFICE HAVE BEEN HERE FOR MORE THAN A YEAR WITHOUT A SINGLE ADVANCEMENT. IT ISN'T BECAUSE OF THEIR WORK EITHER. BUT WHY GRIPE TO YOU? WE DO IT AMONGST OURSELVES AND HAVE A WONDERFUL TIME.

I'M STILL GALAVANTING AROUND THIS COUNTRY AND FINDING NEW THINGS ALL THE TIME. RECENTLY, I LANDED IN A MOVIE STUDIO AND WATCHED TWO SCENES OF A BRITISH FILM BEING TAKEN. IT WAS QUITE AN ADVENTURE BEING ON A REAL SET, WHICH LOOKED LIKE ANY HOLLEYWOOD MOVIE MIGHT HAVE. TONIGHT, (AND I'M COUNTING THE HOURS [ILLEGIBLE] THE OFFICE), TWO OF US ARE GOING TO SEE AND HEAR VIVIEN LEIGH (SCARLET O'HARA) AND LAWRENCE OLIVIER BROADCAST. WE'RE GOING MIGHTY EARLY TO GET FRONT ROW SEATS TO SEE IF THE AFFOREMENTIONED LADY A LOVEYLY AS SHE WAS ON THE SCREEN.

HARRIET GANDEL, FRANKIE [ILLEGIBLE], AND SEVERAL FEMINIE ALUMNAE PALS WRITE TO ME REGULARLY AND TELL ALL. I GUESS I DON'T HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT MAIL TIME IS THE BEST PART OF THE DAY AND THE WORST IF THOSE TINT V MAIL ENVELOPES DON'T FALL INTO OUR LAPS. SEND MY BEST REGARDS TO MISS LIPSON AND ALL OF NSTC. SINCERELY

SIDNEY
