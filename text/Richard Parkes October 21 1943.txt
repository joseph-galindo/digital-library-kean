Dear Miss Thompson: 
Gee whiz!!! Am I embarrassed, just as me am I?  Yes, I am!  I should have written so long ago, but even my family is down on me, for I never get to write to them either except maybe once a week or less. I am about to be disowned. 
I did so enjoy your nice long letter received yesterday.  See how prompt I am this time? The reason that I didn't stop in to see you all at school in august, is for the simple reason that I was home just three days when I received a wire to return immediately via Baltimore, Maryland.  I didn't do half the things I had planned, but I expect to leave for the East Coast about the eleventh of November, so I shall see everyone at the time I hope.  
Things are very busy out here, but going very well, and I love my work.  My broadcast is not originateing from the Base theatre and seems to be quite popular.  Along with everything else, it is quite a job to write a script every week.  I'm glad the broadcast isn't any longer than a half hour!  
I manage ro get in quite a bit of horseback riding, and naturally I love it, as I always have.  The officer in charge of special services Now is a great horseman, and a beautiful rider, consequently we get along very well -- also, there is only a difference of two years in our ages -- even though he is a captain.  
School must seem very funny without a bunch of "guys" hanging around.  I'd love it!  I'm very anxious to get back, for I have a million and one questions to ask. 
I hope this letter finds you well, and please say "hello" to all at N.S.T.C. for me. 
                                  	As ever, 
               Dick
