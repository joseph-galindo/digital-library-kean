Dear Miss Thompson;

Thank you for your card; It was quite a surprise, but a pleasant one that was & is sincerely appreciated.

Things at camp are about the same. We only teach 48 hrs. per week, eight hours a day. But I enjoy every minute of it.

You certainly were right about Ohio being a beautiful place. The grass is just beginning to get green and the trees are starting to budd. The weather is like summer average temp  -  68-75. days, 50-70 nights. It is just about perfect.

Do you remember that set of project for servicemen I sent for? Well, I just received it. The pamphlet contains several project plans but not a sufficient quantity to cover the scope of work we are doing. However I am trying to contact some book stores in Toledo to try to get some project magazines & books.

I never realized how much I missed the college until I returned for that one day. It was just like come back home after being away for a long time & finding things just about the same as you left. Even though you expected great changes in things.

My fencing career is not ended thanks to a fencing club I found in Sandusky, Ohio. I now fence there once or twice a week. It is a great sport & helps to keep my mind & body active.

That is about all of the news for now. Please excuse the terrible writing. I am using one of the U.S.O Pens and it is terrible. So combined with my poor penmanship, you see the result.

Please remember me to the faculty.

Sincerely,

Frank Tansey
