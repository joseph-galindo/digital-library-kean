Dear Miss Thompson:
	I received your letter this morning and was really surprised to hear from you.
	I have been trying to write to you for quite some time best it seems that something interfere all the time.
	You can hardly imagine how much I enjoyed visiting at School even though it was only for a few minutes.   If we are not sent off too soon maybe I'll get another chance to see you folks again.
	We have been here for two weeks now and have enjoyed, immensely, our stay.
	We have a great deal of entertainment so we don't find it hard to keep our spare time occupied.
	Even though we have evenings and and weekends off we still have classes during the day.
	We have movies every night.  There is a Y.M.C.A on the premises, + a service that hold shows, dances, movies and other social gatherings.
	Some evenings we have off and its only half hour from to Times Square!  So you can see it's not  quite like away life when you add to all this the fact that I go home every weekend.  Visitors are allowed here and would like nothing better than to see some of my classmates.  If anyone is interested tell them to let me know.  But then I suppose most of them are in the Service already or waiting to be called.  I wish those going the best of luck.
	I was sorry to hear of all the "casualties" at N.S. and hope that by this time all is running smoothly again.
	I appreciated your letter very much and thank you for being so considerate of me after not having written myself first.  I've enjoyed hearing all the goings on of good old ALMA MATER.
	Give my best to Mr. Hutchinson, Dr. Shea, (illegible), and all the rest of the folks and I'll try to be good and write more after. 
	Best of everything 
	Sincerely
   Sgt. Carlo Landolfi
