Somewhere in Italy

Dear Mr. Sloan,

Received your lovely card this morning. My address had changed twice in the past 6 weeks so that it was held up. Will you tell Miss Thompson that I also received hers. I'm not writing her a separate letter because I can't tell about all the things I've seen and places I've visited in Italy  -  censor says now.

I was in Africa for almost a year and visited all the big cities with the exception of Algeria and Casablanca. Tunis was a lovely city. Many of the people, especially the children, can speak English. The most picturesque city I've seen so far was Constantinople. It could be seen for a long way from the bottom of the valley. There doesn't seem to be any sign of any transition from the old Arabic civilization to modern French life. Walking down a side alley and you step almost off this world. The roar of the planes and vehicles always serves as a grim reminder of why we are over here. As soon as I can I'll write about Italy. 

Regards to the rest of the faculty.

Bernard Braverman
