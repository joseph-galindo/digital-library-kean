MAXWELL FIELD, ALA.

17 July 1944

Dear Nancy  - 

I guess I'm the black sheep of your family. In fact I deserve a few good reprimands for my very poor writing habits. Hope you will continue to forgive the old prodigal.

Just for the record, I graduated from Peabody 2 months ago and spent some time at Spence Field, Georgia before winding up here at Maxwell  -  This cadet life is a most rugged existence. Academics, physical training, the infernal heat and exacting military discipline are wearing me down to a skeleton of my former self. I'm getting along quite well  -  and after the years I've spent as a G.I., I should be quite resigned to the military.

Just received a copy of the "Service Men's News" and was shocked to hear of Jackman's death. How can one ever justify wars when they take the lives of so many fine boys like Jackman. This business must come to an end. It's utterly senseless.

Thanks for keeping me on your mailing list. The news from home and of the men I knew is most appreciated.

I suppose you know that I have been classified as a navigator and upon completion of the pre-flight course here, I expect to be assigned to some navigation school to complete my training. I hope to get into celestial navigation one of these days and get across preferably on a B-29.

Perhaps you'd like to know that I ascended to 38,000 feet in the high altitude chamber here and it was quite an experience. Fool that I am, I elected to play guinea pig and "went up" sans oxygen mask and passed out beautifully at about 27,000 feet. The queer thing about it was that I never knew I had lost consciousness and still maintain that I was full aware of everything at all times. This "oxygen lack" is a very queer business.

If I'm not "washed out", I should remain here until some time in September. Hoping for a furlo. If so I shall definitely try to see you once more.

Please keep writing

Sincerely  -  

Seymour
