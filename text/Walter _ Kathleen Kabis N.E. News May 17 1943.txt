Ensign Walter Kabis (1936)

	Ensign Walter L. Kabis, U.S. N.R., of Newark has been busy going places and doing things since he went to sea in February.  He says in a recent V letter, however, "There is so little I'm permitted to say and so much I'd like to say that my letters sound hollow when I read them over."
	But in spite of being careful (and the censor did block out one word) Walt manages to tell quite a bit which will interest his friends and former pupils.
	"As an armed guard commander aboard a merchant vessel I am responsible for a Navy gun crew, the guns (and they aren't exactly the kind one carries on his shoulder) and the defense of the ship in case of attack.  The experience is a wonderful one of course; thrilling at times, but I'll be doggoned glad when it's over.
                           Cargo Jerry Won't Like
   "As I write this we are in the Atlantic on our way to another European port with a cargo which I know will help a great deal in getting Jerry.  There's a great deal of satisfaction in that feeling, particularly after seeing what his bombers did to a certain city I visited the last time over.  Here's hoping it never happens back home."
	Mrs. Kabis considers it was a lucky break for her when Walt's ship needed a repair job last month.  Of all the available ports equipped to do the job, the ship's owners chose New York, so she had her first and only glimpse of him at that time.
