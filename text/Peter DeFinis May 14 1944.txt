My Dear Miss Thompson,

This has been the first opportunity I've had to write you in some time. I have been busy with my Army duties and working in a ship yard too.

The shipyard has been short handed for some time and has asked the Army for permission to let we Army fellows work there when we are not on duty. They have inaugurated a Victory Shift.

The Victory Shift enables a soldier to work whenever he can find the time to do so. There is no starting time, you start work when you can.

I enjoy this type work for it gives me a broader knowledge of industrial arts.

Last week received a college newspaper. I noticed that it had been sent to the wrong address. I'm always anxious to know what activities take place at my alma mater. Would you kindly make a note of my address to whomever mails the college publications.

Enclosed also find a picture of myself. Forgive me for not sending one as I had promised some time ago.

My best and sincerest to your Miss Thompson, to the faculty and to the student body of the college.

Sincerely,

Peter De Finis
Class "43"
