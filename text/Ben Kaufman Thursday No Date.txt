Dear Mr Sloan
	Believe it or not I think of you often  -  and should I forget  -  in this exacting job  -  for a while, then I get a copy of your excellent "Service Men's News" and read about you and your trips or your St Patrick's Day parties. Tell me honestly Mr. Sloan how can you take it all by yourself, what I mean is  -  now with so many of the men away how can you handle those galaxies of Normal School beauties alone?
	As you see Im at Tuskegee Army Air Air Field  -  an all Negro  -  and the only Negro flying field in the country  -  and we believe its the best. The work here is largely research the [Note: likely meant "though"] we have some standardized tests  -  the purpose of which is to pre determine pilot success or failure. The work is exhausting and wonderful. Had asked for and was given permission to go across and continue this work before coming here  -  but the powers made a last minute change. However, still hoping.
	How are the gang at N.S? Give my love to Bertha Cain  -  Martha Downs  -  Thompson (I know it isn't Sadie), Baldwin    ,    ly and Levy (Misses) - Gosh isn't my English tied up. However don't forget to give my best to Wildy Windy  -  or was Windy Wildy we called him, (Singer)  -  He's a great inspiration. 
	Hope you're all well and that I continue to get your unimpressive but quite delightful Serviceman's Paper.

                                                                   	Sincerely,
                                                                   Ben Kaufman

P.S. Believe Miss Baldwins first name was Marcia and isn't Miss Thompson's Elizabeth.  - 

Believe I can supply your psych dept with a job or two if they're really looking for work.
                                     Ben
