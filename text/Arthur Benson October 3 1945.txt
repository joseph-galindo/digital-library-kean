Dear Miss Thompson,

I have your very interesting letter in front of me, attempting for the third time to answer it. The last attempt was on the twenty third of Sept. 

I'm afraid my excuse is the old "nothing much has happened." 

Now that censorship has been lifted I can tell you that I am on the island of Le Shima. As far as I can see its only claim to fame is that Ernie Pyle was killed here. Oh, yes the Jap peace envoys landed here on the way to Manila. I have quite a few pictures of the group.

The island is 3x5 miles and in the months I've been here has shrunk to considerably less than that.

I'm not "Rock Happy", (professional disease) as yet because actually its climate and the work is agreeable. We've had several typhoons but to a Jerseyite they are not very impressive.

Is the school offering refresher courses to returning service men? I will have to return to school before I can teach. Since I will probably be home in April I will have several months to brush up on my English and LA(sp?) technique at least.

The way things stand now I would proceed to give a class "At Ease" "give me your attention" and promptly deal out company punishment to any violators. I'm afraid such actions would not be looked upon in the proper light by a school board.

I wonder if you could prevail upon Miss Ewald to send me a catalogue of the courses that are being offered and perhaps an estimate of the courses to be offered this coming summer.

Please give my regards to the President and members of the faculty and Miss Huber (the dicoy(sp?)). Incidentally Miss Thompson you are a very good decoy yourself. You've gotten me to write in spite of myself. Will you tell Mr. Richmond that for at least a year and a half I have been going to write him!

Again, thank you for your letter and I hope I'm forgiven for not writing sooner.

Sincerely,

Art Benson
