Dear Miss Thompson, 
	Just a few lines to let you know that I am still at this Air Base.  I am doing Photography as usual.  It is very interesting.  There is all always something new to learn.  We have the best of equipment as you might expect. 
	Since I have been home on my furlough many things have happened here on the Base.  When I first arrived here there was not very much discipline.  Now that the Base is getting better organized the officers are tightening up Rules and regulations a being made and inforced.
	I have had a good time here although they is plenty of work connected with. . . . .been flying quite a bit allow . . . . time of course. 
. . . .Miss Thompson this brings. . . .end of this letter.
						Sincerely
						Robert M. Kaeppel
