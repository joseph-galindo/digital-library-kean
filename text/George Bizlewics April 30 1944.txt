AIR FORCES OFFICER CANDIDATE SCHOOL
MIAMI BEACH, FLORIDA

30 April 44

Dear Miss Thompson,

Received another issue of the "Servicemen's News" and enjoyed learning about all the boys from school.

I can see that the news is up to date on o/c Bizlewicz, and the letter was sent to my old base in Jamaica and had to be resent to Miami Beach.

This OCS is really a proving ground. I've never experienced anything as tough, nor ever imagined anything could be as tough as the two months I've spent here at OCS. The strain of studies at times seems almost too much to hear. Time seems so limited, with so much to do, that I often wonder how one is able to accomplish all that is set up in the curriculum. We have learned that studies and program in general here at O.C.S. is built up on a pressure system. It was designed to place as much work as possible on the candidates, and those that could withstand any jop given him as an officer under any given condition. We're really learning the hard way.

Things are going well and in two weeks we hope to go on (illegible). This will complete our third month of training and then it's onto the greatest day of our career, graduation day, which is the 24[th] of June. That will be the biggest thrill in my life!

Sending best wishes to you, Miss Lipson and other members of the school faculty.

Sincerely,

George -
