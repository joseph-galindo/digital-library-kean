Transciber's note  -  This letter is about Theodore Lucciola, but not by him.  Author unknown at this time.
Dear Miss Thompson,
	Ted Lucciola, I believe, has the distinction of being our first active student called to the service.  He had been in the Nat. Guard in the summer of 1940.  That fall he came back and enrolled as a sophmore but was called for a year of active service when the N.J. Nat. Guard was mobilized under federal service.  Hence he left in 2 days.  1940-1941 he served his year.  He returned here Sept. 1941 and took his soph. year.  Was called again at end of college year 1942

Think John Durante has the edge here.  {Transcriber's note  -  this sentance does not seem to be related to the letter  -  may be a note written on the back of the paper by someone.}
