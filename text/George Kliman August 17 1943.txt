DEAR MISS THOMPSON,

YOUR LETTER CERTAINLY BROUGHT AND BRINGS GREAT PLEASURE TO ME SINCE I REALIZE THAT YOU DO HAVE SO MANY OTHER DUTIES THAN TO CARRY ON CORRESPONDENCE AT THE PRESENT.

IT SURE WAS GOOD TO HEAR THE NEWS ABOUT COLLEGE AND DISCOVER THE GREAT CHANGES THAT HAVE OCCURRED SINCE WAR WAS DECLARED. THE REALITY OF KNOWING THAT SO MANY OF OUR FRIENDS ARE OVERSEAS HAS NOT PERCEIVED THIS HEAD OF MINE. TO KNOW THAT SO MANY OF OUR BOYS ARE OVERSEAS BRINGS A FEELING OF PRIDE TO MY HEART, AS I KNOW THAT THEY ARE FIGHTING AND ADVANCING TOWARD THAT ULTIMATE GOAL, VICTORY. HERE'S HOPING THAT I MAY JOIN THEM ON THE FIGHTING FRONTS, AND HELPT TO BRING ABOUT THE END OF OUR BOYS' ACCOMPLISHMENTS.

I SHALL TRY MY VERY BEST TO KEEP IN TOUCH WITH YOU, AND SHOULD I EVER COME ACROSS THE PATHS OF OUR COLLEGE STUDENTS, WHEREVER THEY MAY BE, YOU WILL HEAR THE NEWS. WITH BEST WISHES FOR THE WELFARE OF THE FACULTY, AND YOUR OWN GOOD HEALTH.

SINCERELY YOURS,

GEORGE KLIMAN
