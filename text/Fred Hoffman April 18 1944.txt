Dear Miss Thompson,

Can not write very much as censorship is very strict here. Am somewhere in England attached to the eighth air force. Can say nothing about the trip, what we are doing, describe the weather, surrounding spots etc. 

English money is quite artistic but a bit cumbersome. Simply a matter starting with penny, then shillings, crowns, and then pounds.

Suspect that the English people as a race are too polite and subtle to be (over) appreciated by the average American. Being a small country too, they recognize the need for privacy  -  familiarity only breeds contempt.

I want to see as much of England as I possibly can. We can learn a lot from them. Have you ever traveled in England?

The Red Cross seems to be doing a very good job from all that I've experienced.

Is now 2100 over here; only 1500 in Newark, New Jersey. Something to think about. They moved the clocks up two hours over here. It works out very well. Â¶ Will enjoy hearing from you more than ever. Trust that everything is still running smoothly down at school. Cheerio. Fred Hoffman
