Camp Barkeley, Texas
July 25, 1943

Dear Miss Thompson,

I feel guilty the way I have neglected writing to you before this. I know that you will realize the situation a poor soldier finds himself in the first weeks away from home. Free time is practically non-existent, and the little we do get is spent in that grand pastime, sleep.

As you can see, I am deep in the heart of Texas, taking my basic training in the Medical Corps. It is an interesting training that we receive although it is a little harrowing at times. The officers are a splendid bunch and a pleasure to work with.

To say that I miss all of you at Newark State is an understatement. I am praying for the day I can return. But meanwhile, there is a job to do, and I am proud to do my small bit. It is really a small sacrifice that any of us are making. I've tried to study the feelings of the boys I've met so far. We may all complain a little and gripe about this and that, but on the whole and with very little exception, I think the boys take pride in the service. Boys seeking discharges are treated with contempt. I rather think that is why we are going to win this fight.

I received the yearbook while still at Fort Dix and I wish to thank you very much for it. I was very glad to receive it.

I received letters from all the students I taught in practice. It did my heart good. I have read and reread them many times.

One nice thing is that five of us from school are together here: Harold Atterbury, Geral Ferraro, Gabriel Rudnitsky, Menna Trapaneze, and myself. We can always talk over old times.

Well, this will have to be it for now. As the clock says it's bed time. Tomorrow begins another week. Please let me hear from you soon.

Sincerely,

Bob Clausen
