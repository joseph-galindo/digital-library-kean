Dear Miss Thompson;

It was grand to hear from you, and all about my classmates. I'll confine this note entirely to the library situation. Later I'll write more about myself.

First of all there is an oversupply of old discarded books, while new ones are few. Both fiction (not light) and non fiction are equally read. A few new books are worth more than a thousand 1900 or 1910 editions such as we have.

Our periodical situation seems to be adequate. There too local citizens bring in truck loads of old magazines that seldom leave the shelves. Current newspapers are quite popular. Our library subscribes to many including the Times and the Inquirer. 

Trusting that this information will be of use, I remain

Yours as Ever

Raymond Kowalick
