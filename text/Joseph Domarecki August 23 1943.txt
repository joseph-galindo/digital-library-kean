Dear Miss Thompson.

I can't tell you how much I enjoyed your letter telling of your unusual and most interesting connection with our men in the armed forces from our "Alma Mater". I am sending the letter on to Joe tonight as I know he will be thrilled to read it not to mention the Service Men's News. I started to read those pamphlets and before I knew it I kept recognizing a name here and there and connecting that name with a familiar happening back at good old Teachers College. Thank you ever so much for those pamphlets  -  I know how Joe will appreciate them. He is now stationed at Pearl Harbor, Honolulu and his address is:

Ensign Joseph T. Domarecki
Staff  -  Fleet Air Wing Two
c/o Fleet Post Office
San Francisco, Cal.

I am enclosing a picture of Joe and myself. I wish I had one of Joe alone to send you but I have only one large one at home. If it should happen that Joe will be granted a furlough in the near future and come home, we will be only too glad to visit the college and look over your wonderful work and once again see our old friends.

Please send the papers to Joe as I know how much they will mean to him and thank you once again for your interest in us.

Sincerely,

Helen Domarecki
