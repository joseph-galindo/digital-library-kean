[Season's Greetings]


Dear Dr. Schaffer-

	Thanks a million for the brother album with the photographs of college scenes in it.

	I assume you think it is more than appreciated. It surprised me to see the interest that it has aroused among the rest of my soldier friends.

	I'm trying my best to do my small share in this war. I know that you are doing your part. You keep `em educated and I'll keep `em flying.
