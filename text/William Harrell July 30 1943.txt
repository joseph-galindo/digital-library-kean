Dear Miss Thompson,

Please excuse the pencil and my writitng but I still feel "kinda" weak. I've gotten over the worse stages of pneumonia. After I left college the other day I went home and collapsed I nbed where I have been ever since. Naturally I couldn't get back to Atlantic City so the Army sent an ambulance for me and brought me over here to Staten Island.

The first few days were terrific but I am beginning to feel much better but am oh so weak. The one nice thing about this place is that my mother can get over to visit me in the afternoon, when we have visiting hours from 2 to 4.

The Red Cross sends a Gray Lady every couple of days and she provides us with these little necessities that mean so much  -  i.e, toothpaste, shaving cream, magazines, writing paper etc.

Tell everyone at college I really enjoyed my brief visit but I am sorry I couldn't stay longer.

Best regards

Bill Harrell
