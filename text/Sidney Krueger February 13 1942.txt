Dear Miss Thompson:

Although belated, greetings from Puerto Rico. Having written countless letters during my first 3 months on the Island, I decided to write only to the family after Jan 1, 1942. Unfortunately most of my letters went to the wrong people.

Two-thirds of my stay is now over. My sixth grade has learned a little English, so they tell me. Their teacher, (who has taken a fancy to their language) has acquired invaluable experience  -  professional and otherwise. The nine months, will more than compensate the discomfort, homesickness, and illness my first 3 months provided me with. My main desire now is a teaching position in the good old U.S.A.

A good number of us should leave our country for a spell. The Star Spangled Banner means more to me now than ever before.

Surprise blackouts and newspaper headlines are the only evidences of the war here.

Although I don't deserve it, I'd enjoy hearing from you.

Sincerely

Sidney
