Dear Miss Thompson,
	Life in the Ol' ETO ain't so hot! At present we fellows in the Medical Detachment are fortunate because a near by farmer volunteered the use of an extra building, so we keep warm and dry. ( at least part of the time). The rest of the gang however has to soak it out in winterized tents. Some are considering renovating them into GI houseboats to prevent any discomfort in case they should suddenly start floating down the road.
