Dear Miss Thompson,

This should be my last step along the road, at least this side of the "wings" if all goes well; but that's twenty weeks away at this writing. You see, we have just arrived here from Ellington Field where 9 weeks of pre-flight plus two more weeks of just plain waiting had to pass before we made our trek to this Advanced Navigation school.

The few easterners left from the group that was herded out of Newark almost ten months ago feel sort of mislaid out here, even more than at Ellington because usually this field draws from the west coast area only, and our bunch was the first from the central zone in quite a time. But, we haven't got much time or ambition to worry about things like that here  -  we go to school from 7:30 to 4:30 and 7:30 to 9:30 at night  -  ah yes from 4:30 to 5:30 is athletics, and retreat is at 6. So you can easily see that we don't rust from inactivity around here.

All our equipment was issues to us the other day, and I never dreamed that was so much to this affair. I'd never try to enumerate all the paraphernalia we accumulated but all together it weighed 72 pounds, which you must admit is quite a bit to worry over.
