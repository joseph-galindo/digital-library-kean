Dear Mr. Hutchinson  -  

Still at Stewart Field and still enjoying whatever the Army has to throw at me  -  This business of being a crew chief to a basic trainer is not a bed of roses by any stretch of imagination  -  In fact our work schedule is at least a 12 hour day with a few 24 hour jobs thrown in  -  So far so good however  -  No crackups and lots of flights  -  

I've been doing lots of flying and really running the gamut of flight maneuvers as well as formation flying  -  Really convinced that there's nothing like flight  -  Feel absolutely majestic and free up there with the earth a green and brown checker board belove me  -  Rave, Rave, Rave! Flight  -  it's wonderful  -  

Just moved out of my temporary tent and am no housed in a luxurious barracks with 30 other young valiants  -  Quite an improvement too  -  

At present am sealed quite complacently at a night course in Newburg subject to one of those instructors who possesses not only a negative personality but has been stalling for 1 (1/2) hours since he has not received his textbooks for the course  -  Oh yes  -  it's a pre-flight aeronautics course (civilian), 2 nights weekly, covering meteorology, navigation and aerodynamics  -  all high sounding but meaninglessin the light of this insipid creature who dares to stand before us and attempt to teach  -  Nuff said  -  

Well my officer's candidate training seems to be shaping up. I would appreciate a letter of recommendation should you care to send one  -  If so may I have it as soon as possible  -  Address it to the Officer Candidate Selection Board  - 

How is N.S.T.C. shaping up? Any men left?

Really miss K.C. Mo! Sure wish I as back there  -  Easterners absolutely do not compare with those wonderful midwesterners. You should know  -  I believe that Lynd says something about that in Middletown  - 

Hope to hear from you soon  - 
Sincerely,

Gelbond
