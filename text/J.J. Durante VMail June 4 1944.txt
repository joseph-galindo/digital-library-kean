"ITALIA"

Dear Miss Thompson,

Your letter is certainly appreciated. We enjoy receiving letters here but are first class delinquents when its our turn. So Newark is still there? Sure can't prove it by me, since the last glimpse I had was a year ago April 27, the night before I left for the "dark continent". Life here is not the same as usual. Whereas we had a tough line to crack for months without result, now our armies are plodding ahead without letup.

June 6.

We just received the great news: Allied troops landed in France!. We hope that someone signs his John Hancock on the document which will make possible our return by this Christmas. Gis have a one track mind, consumed only by the desire to return home as soon as possible and in one piece.

Yesterday, on one of my infrequent passes I visited those towns which were covered by volcanic dust. To me those large heaps of gray black ash resembled the dirty snow slush that you see in Newark a few days after a 12 inch snow fall. That was my first impression. The volcano itself created quite a spectacle when it belched smoke, ash, and lava. Despite the hill country huge formations of reddish smoke could be seen from a distance of more the 50 miles. I do feel sorry for you people who are forced to stay home. Lucky you. My greatest hope is that I shall have an I.A. shop soon. Best regards... John(?)
