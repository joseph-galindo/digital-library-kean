ISTRES, FRANCE
3 DECEMBER 1945

DEAR MISS THOMPSON:

It has been quite some time since I have written to anyone at the old "alma matter". I trust that you will overlook my negligence and once more include me in your correspondence list. I have not received any news from the college since August therefore you can readily understand how starved I am for news of the "old gang".

A great deal has happened to me since last August. On the 15[th] of September  was one of many scheduled to sail from Marseille to the C.B.I. theater...direct. With the advent of V-J day this trip was cancelled and the old 837[th] Engr. Arm. Bn. ordered back to work at the old stand  -  Istres Airfield. Eventually I was freed from the confines of the company orderly room and given a job as platoon commander. In the middle of October, much the worse from wear from being subjected to the infamous blastly mistrial, I was transferred to the 108 Labor Supervision Center. My present assignment is that of company commander in charge of 250 exmembers of the super-race engaged in labor details scattered over Istres Airfield. This assignment is indeed a welcome change. The position (I can't rightfully dignify it by terming it as work) is most interesting. The German POWs are quite amazing in their skills and capabilities. It is surprising to see them intricate gadgets out of what is ordinarily considered as trash. But in spite of the uniqueness of this assignment I am still looking for someone who will give me an answer to my question, "When will I go home".

Enough about me, how about some news from the college? What is the college doing about courses for returning servicemen who did not complete their schooling? Have you had any news about the men from Sigma Theta Chi fraternity? Please give my regards to any that may drop in to visit with you. Please write soon.

Pat
