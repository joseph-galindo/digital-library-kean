Dear Miss Thompson:

Today, I received your card. I can't thank you enough for it. I really think it's great the way you people are remembering us fellows in the service.

I expect to be home some time in February and I'll certainly stop in and see you people.

Thanks again.

Sincerely,

Francis Bigley
