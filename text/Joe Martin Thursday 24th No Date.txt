Dear Miss Thompson,
	I have no excuses to offer for this very belated answer  -  but I have away from camp on furlough the past fourteen days.  
	I found a very pleasant surprise on my bunk when I returned last night  -  the photo case.  Would you convey my thanks to those who made it possible.
	The scenes pictured are very familiar to me  -  but the faces, I must admit, are entirely new Four Years, though, is a long time.  It seems the feminine sex still has about a four to one edge over the boys.  Lucky guys! 
	I suspect that I am one of the more fortunate service men who to be able to spend a winter in Florida.  After experiencing that cold wave in Jersey it was nice to get back here  -  from -2° to 84° in twenty four hours.
	I'm at present instructing in aircraft warning  -  extremely interesting work.  The hours are nice, the food is excellent, and with tours (1/4) mile away it makes the entire set-up ideal.  It wasn't until I was on furlough that I realized how much civilian life is regimented  -  gasoline, butter, coffee, sugar  -  and a lot of other restrictions.  Would you believe that I was relieved to get back to the Army to escape all that regimentation?
	Thank you for your thoughtfulness.
		With Kindest regards,
		     Joe Martin

P.S.	The Reflector, by the way, arrives regularly.  Thanks
		JM
