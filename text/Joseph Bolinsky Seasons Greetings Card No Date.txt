(Season's Greetings Card)

Dear Miss Thompson,

How are you and those we know at school?

I'm in England just finishing a 3 months study at a school here, where I have been doing sculpture in in stone and wood. It has been excellent. We have been living like civilians and having the opportunity of doing much work and study. I have completed a wood planet, a stone head, and a stone group of figures  -  "Mother and child" as well as lettering in the tradition of Eric(sp?) Gill.

Best regards to all.

Joe Bolinsky
