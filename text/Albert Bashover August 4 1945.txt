4 August 1945

Dear Miss Thompson,

I just received your V-mail about Ralph. I couldn't write a letter to his parents. Your V-mail didn't have a date and the way my mail has been arriving it may have been sent quite a while ago. You know that old saying that time heals all wounds  -  well perhaps the Sozio's are getting over the shock of Ralph's death, I wouldn't want to be the one to remind them of a sad experience. I hope you and they understand. If you ever meet Mr. Sozio, give him my best wishes. A personal contact is so much more delicate. You /know, in a way I think Ralph is much more alive as far as the school and his friends are concerned than many of the fellows that call themselves alumnus. He will always visit the school when someone sings "College Daze". I know that when I come back to Newark State Ralph will be with me whenever someone laughs at one of his comedy songs. Ya can't keep a good guy down  -  and Ralph was a good guy. Perhaps I'm getting sentimental, but Ralph's personality is one you can't forget. It cannot and will not die as long as you and I ) and all the other fellows are around to remember. We are going to have "College Daze" again.

I'm sorry it took an occasion like this to make me write to you. There are a lot of things I would like to tell you about, like crossing the equator nine times to date  -  like flying in a B-25 bomber  -  like having my life saved because of an angry Major (details censored)  -  like sitting on tons of high explosives during an invation. Your desk in the library will be my first stop when I hit Newark State again. Get ready for a long session of storytelling.

Albert
