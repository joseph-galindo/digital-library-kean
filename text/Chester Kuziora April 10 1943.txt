[VMAIL]

Dear Miss Thompson:
	Things were happening so fast around here that I honestly didn't find time to answer your V letter dated Feb 28. And now while I have all the time in the world to write I can't. The pen seems to weigh tons. Like a thunderbolt from the sky it struck me without warning  -  that dreaded malaira fever. Let me tell you it's worse than all hell put together.
	I can't expect any mail from you people as per the regular route  -  but it'll get here.
	I'll try to answer some of your questions briefly as I'm getting a bit tired  -  but promise upon recovery to do some writing.
	Though I can't get a request now, I've heard that packages weighing 8 ounces can be sent free. If so  -  how much does a roll of film weigh
	As to the snapshots, I'm sure they hold. I still have the negative, so more can be made when + if I touch that grand terra firma of U.S.A.
	Your books were a thoughtful gift, just the thing to do when you're not doing anything.
	But unfortunately, I hear that Davy Jones is also making some collections. Bye until I hear from you. A Happy Easter to all.
                                                                          Chet
