Dear Miss Thompson,
	
	Please excuse me for not writing before even though I can not offer you a good excuse for my lack of writing. I admit my negligence so please excuse me.
Our stay here in New York is very good. I've been home the past two weekends and starting tonight, I can go home every night between 6:20 + 11:20. After not being home for 11 weeks, it really is swell to get home some often. 
	I've been accepted for Engineering in the Army College Program. I don't know where or when I'll go to school. 
	Of the 36 Newark State boys who were together at Fort Dix, Mel Whiting, Walt Flint, Sean Bubel, Abe Resnick + I are here. Bubel started going to C.C.N.Y today.
	The Army hasn't treated me bad at all except for the fact that I didn't get home while I was at Atlantic City. The Army life in the latter city was quite easy. 
	How are things in school? Has anything of interest happened lately? 
	I have a formation in 5 minutes so I must end now. 
	I assure you that you won't have to wait as long for my second letter as you did for my first. 
                                                                                 Sincerely
                                                                 Cecil Pollack
