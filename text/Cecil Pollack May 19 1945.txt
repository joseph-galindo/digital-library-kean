Dear Miss Thompson, 

	Well, another one of your "boys" has made the trip across the pond. 
	We've been in France right now about two weeks but we still don't have our final APO number yet. We hope to get it soon + when we do I'll let you know. Meanwhile however, can be sent to my present APO number. 
	Our work at the present time consists of guarding German PWs while they work. We go on duty at noon + guard them till 9 in the evening. We resume duty again at 7 AM + stay on till noon. We then have 24 hours off + go on again at noon. I can't complain for it's pretty easy especially when you yourself don't have to work.
	There are a lot of repatriated American prisoners awaiting shipment to the U.S.A. They are always telling us to make them work harder + to treat them rough in payment for the way the Germans treated them. 
	The Censorship business by the [illegible] commander has ceased, and now there is only a port check by the base censor. 
	We are located between the camp and Wreppe on the channel, North east of Rauen.
	I saw a little of Le Harve and spent a 14 hour pass in Fecamp. The latter used to be a summer resort in peace time. The town itself has few war marks but the beach is well battered as is part of the harbor. 
	As we took a boat ride along the Seine in my first few days in France, I saw some of the prettiest country that I have ever seen. 
	Well  -  give my regards to everyone and write when you can. 

	Cecil
