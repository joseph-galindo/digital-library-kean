Dear Dr. Downs,

Possibility that I might be using a lot of trigonometry in the near future. Been classified for surveying by the Air Corps. Will keep my fingers crossed until I get to advanced school, the Air Forces has a way of switching you around whenever they need men somewhere in a hurry, so I'll just have to hope that things go as scheduled.

I certainly appreciate the trouble you went to in order to come in early to teach our trig class. One course that I really enjoyed. Wish I had done more homework, though I tried not to miss very much in class.

Basic here at Atlantic City includes plenty of drilling and calisthenics. Want to be sure that you can handle yourself should the need arise. Give you all that you'll take, but don't stand over you with a bayonet to force you on.

Tempo of living is much faster than civilian life in many ways, though much of the army program is routine repetition.

Many of the fellows from school are here for basic. All seem to be doing well.

Excuse this pencil; can't get ahold of a pen. Only a temporary inconvenience. Guess you can read a word every now and then. 

Have a good summer's vacation.
