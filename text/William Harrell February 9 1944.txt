Dear Miss Thompson,

I haven't heard from you in so long. I imagine you must be annoyed with me or else fueding with someone. Who?

My cousin tells me the college is still standing and still in working order, so how's about a letter to a tired and hard studying aviation cadet. Yes I made it, so far, that is.

I have done a little teaching down here while I was in the hospital for a pre-pressure chamber check-up. I instructed a class in novel crafts and studied Spanish myself. It is/was really interesting. I am a bit behind in classes due to the sojourn in the hospital but hope to catch up soon.

Please write and let me know what gives in N.J.S.T.C at N.

Sincerely 

Bill Harrell

P.S. This is my new address.
