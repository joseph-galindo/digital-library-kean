22[nd] Training Group  -  Sq'dn C
Jefferson Barracks, MO

Dear Miss Thompson,

Well here I am back in the Army, and having a swell time. This place is strictly a basic training center, and we have to take our basic training over again. Many of the fellows kicked like mules, but the Army won out in the long run. In the first week of our basic, we took some mechanical aptitude tests. I did very well on these. I have been recommended to attend prop specialist school; that's providing they have an opening, otherwise, I'll be sent to a heavy bombardment outfit as a mechanic. We are now in the process of listening to long boring lectures. Later on we will have to go out on a 20 mile hike to apply what we have learned. This should prove to be a lot of fun, and I'm looking forward to it. All the fellows that I washed out with at Bradley are here with me. That goes a long way towards making things easier, the fact that you know most of the fellows.

The weather here is very damp and cold, and the rate of sickness at this camp due to colds is very high. Pneumonia runs very high due to the fact of the three day camping trips, in which the fellows sleep on the ground for three days.

I expect to be here at least two months but then again the Army can never be trusted. For all I know, I may be shipping out tomorrow.

Well that's all for now, so until something new develops. I'll go back to my field manuals.

Sincerely, 

Ed
