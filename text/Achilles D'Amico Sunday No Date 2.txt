Sunday

Hiya love!

Yes I know, I didn't call on you when I was home last but what you don't know was that my leave was only for 5 days and ended on the 14. "Buck" Bigley was married on the 16 so that is why I wasn't at the wedding. Here is some news for you. I've been at the "front" in this maneuver for 2 solid weeks and have yet to lose eith by capure or casualty one man. We've been employed in bridge building (both on roads and across streams), laying minefields, and breaking through justified positions. 

I'll admit my tactics aren't exactly orthodox (were they ever?) but as the Colonel says, "I don't care how you do it, but do it!"

Tonight, infact, in 2 hours we are attacking a few enemy tanks which my scouts have discovered. These tanks have been seperated from their main body and our bazooka team will put them out of their misery, shortly.

Do I like this? And Now!! You will have to excuse my scribbling, since I am writing from a jeep and the roads are not too considerate.

Please send Panmallo's address and if you write to him, tell him I still love him and await the day we can pull another one of our beer "drunks"  - 

Love to all  - 

Al 

XXXXX (for whoever wants them)

X (for you)
