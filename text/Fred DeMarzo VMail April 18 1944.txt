Dear Miss Balling,

Still somewhere in Englan, working, hoping and praying that peace will be ours soon.

Thank you for the Easter card and letter with all the news from dear old N.S.T.C.

I was especially interested in Mr. Sloan's "St. Patrick's Day Party." Well you can tell him that this honorary Irishman observed the day too. This year I guess more people wore green than ever before and dear St. Pat must have been really pleased. 

Current events in England have been very interesting of late  -  because they have been more concerned with educational trends than ever before.

First some of the papers featured articles about the wonderful new trend in school procedures. The schools were enlarging their libraries and the authorities were encouraging the children to do more research to supplement their textbooks. Rather an old story to us, isn't it? However I'm happy to see that this stand, ultra conservative groups are finally acknowledging our practices. 

More than likely you have read of the Parliamentary crisis resulting from the "Teachers Equal Pay Bill". The people are still discussing it in the local pubs.

Best regards to all.

As ever, your friend,

Freddie
