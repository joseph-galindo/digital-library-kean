Hello Again,

It seems everytime I write its from a different camp. At present I am going to school and hope to become an Navigator. The camp here is fairly nice and there is a swell field for flying. Last week I went up 38,000 feet in a pressure chamber to determine if I were susceptible to the bends or chokes.

Academic work causes me little trouble, but code sort of drives a person mad.

I hope everything is fine and dandy and the college and I want to thank the students and faculty for the Christmas card. It brought Newark State back to the front again and I could clearly remember the delightful times I had during peace time.

Sincerely,

Saul Guritzky
Class 1940
