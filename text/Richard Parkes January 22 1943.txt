Dear Dr. Vaughn-Eames 
	This morning I received a pocket photo album from college.  Through you I wish to extend my thanks to the school. It is something that I shall be able to carry with me, and be able to show with pride to my many transient friends in the army and else-where.  Its sparkle, and originality, are typical of Newark State Teachers. 
	Christmas and New Years came and went ou[t] uninterrupted schedule this year as always. Although the past year hasn't been all that we had hoped, I am sure that many of us have a great deal to be thankful for, we in the army are experiencing coffee-less and butter-less days the same as civilians and our people at home so that the boys doing foreign service can get the good American food that they are used to. This is no hardship for us, and I know that it isn't for people on the home front, and among other things, we are now slicing our own bread, and not by a machine, but by the good old fashioned? bread knife.  How American it is for people to go through these many changes, accept them, and take them in their stride without complaining or disturbing their daily schedules.  
	Things with me are just first rate, and I'm getting lots of valuable experience, especially now since I am an activity sergeant, we manage to keep pretty busy, but enjoy it at the same time, 
	Remember me to Mr. Vaughn-Eames and thanks again 
                                    Dick
