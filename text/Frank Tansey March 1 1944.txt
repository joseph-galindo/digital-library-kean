Dear Miss Thompson;

Your valentine card arrived a few days ago. I am sorry that news has had to reach you second hand. Things are going along fine now, and the future looks very promising. I have been back on the job for a little over a month, and I feel fit as a fiddle. The latest news of my escapades is as follows [censored] the good fortune to be able to [censored] It was a thrilling sight [censored] I'll tell you all about it after the duration. I haven't heard from Carlo lately but I suppose he is just as busy as I am. After all we can't expect a fellow to work all day & to sit in nights & write letters! Can we? Do you still edit that paper (Servicemens). Pardon me I mean does Dr. Vaugn Eames edit it & is it still published. The last one I received came quite a while ago. The paper really has a lot of interesting material in it. I am Cpl. Of the Guard tonight & its time to change guard so I'll have to sign off. Best wishes & regards to all.

Frank Tansey
