K.P. 
Don't know what day it is.....

Mother forwarded your (I think) card to me which reminded me how delinquent I've been. I'll attempt to justify myself by telling you how very busy I have been  -  how new everything here is.

The world is at the [illegible] point and I feel very slithy! Most of the time we are garbed in the most fascinating clothes  -  i.e. 

[Drawing of man: "soup bowl hat", "brown & white seersucker dress", "long cotton stockings", "socks", "high shoes"]

The temperature is about 120 degrees in the sun!

Marching, I love. It's morale building, really, and exciting. We spend most of our day in classes of various kinds  -  Social Hygiene, Map-Reading, Military Sanitation, and Orientation, among others.

The post has a gorgeous swimming pool, P.K.'s scattered all over the place, and Service Clubs galore.

There's nothing like K.P. to make you write gibberish but I promise to send you a sensible letter soon. This is just to let you know I'm alive & happy. My officers are wonderful. I make a beautiful bed but, since we haven't been inspected, I'm sitting on my foot locker.

Please write and tell me the news of the college  - 

Love,

Julia
