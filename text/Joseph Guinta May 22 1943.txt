My dear Miss Thompson,

Just writing to let you know that in the very near future I will be leaving Aberdeen for a west coast port of embarkation and shipment to an overseas outfit. The climate will be tropical and we will wear summer clothes only.

We were supposed to leave here in time to get to the west coast by the 20[th] of May but our orders came late and we were unable to charter the necessary planes. Twenty two of us  -  all 2[nd] Lts.  -  and leaving together. Ten of the boys have been in the Army only 6 months so there must be a dire need for officers.

We do not know the area to which we are going or the type of Co. to which we will be assigned.

In the future my address will be:

2[nd] Lt. Jospeh Giunta
APO #8937
c/o Postmaster
San Francisco California

So long

Joe
