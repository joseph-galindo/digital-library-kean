Dear Miss Thompson:

Thanks a million for your Christmas Card.

Last week, I was sent out here to go to Clerical Administration School. I'll be here for eight weeks and then back to Lincoln. 

It's really wonderful country out here. We're about 5500 feet high and still surrounded by snow capped mountain peaks. The sunrise is breath taking. The best I've seen since I left Florida. When I left Lincoln, it was 6 degrees below zero. Out here, it's like summer.

School hasn't started yet, so now I'm drawing detail. I have a "soft" one. Working in the chapel at the moment. I'm "goofing off," all the work is finished. It only takes an hour a day and I'm on it for eight hours. At this rate, I'll grow old gracefully!

Thanks again for your card, and I hope you have a very pleasant holiday.

Sincerely,

Frank Bigley
