Dear Miss Thompson;

Thank you very kindly for the Christmas Card. It arrived just in time to be very greatly appreciated.

I certainly wish that I were spending the holiday season back there with you people. Perhaps I shall one of these days. So until I see you all again remember me to the folks in the class of "43".

Sincerely yours,

John R. Cairns
