Dear Miss Tompson,

	I received your letter yesterday; I am glad to hear from you. I did not speak to any one from home for such a long time your letter was a treat. You can get in tought with me at any time by writing to:

	Pvt Charles Sermayan
	Squadron B
	36[th] Training Group
	Jefferson Barracks, MO.

	I left the fellows from school at Fort Dix about three weeks ago. I did not hear anything about them. If you do have any of their addresses, I will appreciate your sending them to me.

I do not intend to stay here very long I hope to be sent to 5 months course of G.I. Education over English, speech, math. And little history.

	The county is very beautiful in this part of the west. Our camp is on the shore of the Old Mississippi. The river is moves along slowly for miles along the road that leads to Camp. Speaking about libraries, the libraries in Camp is about three time as large as the library back home. We do not read as many literary material as back home; we have a lot of material of G.I. training manuals. Hope to hear from you soon.

                                                                   Very truly.
                                                                              
                                                              Charles Sermayan
