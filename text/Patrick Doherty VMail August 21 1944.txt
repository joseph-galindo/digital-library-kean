DEAR MISS THOMPSON:

Rejoice for the wandering, wayword prodigal has returned from limbo! The arrival of the June issue of "The News" jarred my conscience but it was not until this moment that I had the urge or energy to write.

I am still in North Africa, but, as ever, am looking for greener pastures. We have been in this one spot so long that we are well known by the natives. They like our company so much...to the extent of paying us nocturnal visits and softly, silently, slipping away with anything that is not tied down. We heard a rumor that the local mayor was thinking of drawing up residents papers for us and asking us to elect a nominee to run for Mayor of the Casbar.

The candle is sputtering so I'll close with regards to all.

Pat
