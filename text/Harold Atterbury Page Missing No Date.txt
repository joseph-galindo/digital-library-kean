Bye now  -  that being the report or just (illegible) to date & will suffice for another 3 or 4 months. 

Write to the boys overseas a(t) war  -  they need it & we don't.

The people down here are (illegible) magnificent  -  nothing's too good for us.

I now have almost as many friends in Tulsa & Murhoquee as I had back in Newark and New York and I daresay its' the same way with the other lads in this country.

It's rough fighting in Italy & its soon going to be hell in France, but my heart goes out to the boys in the South Seas. I'm one of the two malaria "experts" for my company & if it were not for military secrecy I could give you some startling facts. 

Bye now. Might see "you all" on one of these fine days as I'm scheduled for a furlough in March or April.

P.S. Both the hostesses at the Service Club are ex school teachers  -  darn good dancers, too, one is the head librarian. We hear some interesting chats over coffee & tea whenever I get a nite off  -  talk a lot about secondary schools in particular & education in general.

P.S. That Service Men's News is a honey.

P.S. Who should I bump into at the USO dance in Marhopee(sp?) last nite but Paul Fernandez Whooks(sp?)! He's a corporal by the way. 

P.S. I think I need a course in penmanship  -  don't you?
