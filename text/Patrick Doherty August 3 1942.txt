Dear Miss Thompson:

The arrival of Roberts' "Northwest Passage" in yesterday's mail made me one "contented corporal". I am indebted to you for your kindness in purchasing the book just for me. When I have finished with it, I shall donate it, in your name, to the post library.

The past few weeks have seen quite a few changes made here at Langley. In the midst of it all, I, along with many others, received another transfer. For the records, I have been transferred from Hq. to Hq. Squadron, 1[st] Air Base Group to 2[nd] Base Headquarters and Air Base Squadron. I am, however, still working and receiving my mail at the Base Photo Section, Langley Field, VA.

Thanks again for the book, and please give my regards to all at Newark State.

Sincerely,

Pat
