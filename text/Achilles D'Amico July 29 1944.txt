Hi-ya  - 

Here I am again and don't worry about me  -  only the good are suckers and get hurt. I learned to many tricks at NSTC (not found in books, either) to allow Jerry to pull a just one on your little bad boy.

Been here nearly two months and enjoying it immensely. Drink cognac and champagne just to break the monotony of wine. I'm afraid some of my actions are unbecoming to a teacher, but what some teachers would give to share some of my escapades! I'm afraid at the end of this mess, I'll have to take a course in Pre-War Social Relationships in order to fall in the good graces of the hallowed halls of NSTC.

Serious, all is not fun, but I'll be popping in soon just to see if you moved the desks a bit, or added anymore books to your shelf.

Incidently, how's Chief, Mrs Dann, Miss Kain and mah first love  -  Miss Rojad(sp?).

Love  -  Al

PS. You-all-is mah second love!
