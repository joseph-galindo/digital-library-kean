AMARILLO FIELD
AMARILLO, TEXAS

December 30, 1942

Please accept my sincere thanks for your gift  -  the included snapshots and card printed on a N.S.T.C. Press brought back memories which were rapidly and unwillingly being burned under matters of Army routine.

I would like to take the opportunity to thank the members of the Faculty and the Students who sent Holiday Greetings.

Best wishes to all for a Happier New Year-...
