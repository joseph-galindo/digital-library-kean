19 February 1944

Dear Mr. Hess,

Your unique Christmas card, beaucoup traveling, finally came to mon maison. I truly hope that it does not take me as long to go back to the states.

If you thought that I sounded peculiar with what you term a southern colored soldiers speaking with a French accent. And even more amuzing is one Lt. Doherty trying to speak French and Arabic. I think that I am one reason for the international language committee's existence and efforts.

Nothing of importance has happened here of late.

Did manage to run into Bob Behrendt. He certainly has seen some action. In one case he and his shipmates had a close call with one of Jerry's playthings known as mines.

As yet I haven't seen any of this war. Did manage to get over to where they are fighting it. The places that I saw certainly bore out the reports concerning the accuracy and effectiveness of patern and precision bombing.

Regards to all

Say hello to Mr. & Mrs. D'An for me. Also Miss Thompson.

Pat
