U.S Army
CAMP MURPHY, FLORIDA

Sunday Nite

Hello Honey!  -  

Yes, I mean you. Here I am in Florida with new address. I had a date with you Commencement Day, but for some foolish reason, I never did keep it. Now I know you love me, you wrote to me anyway.

I'm still a Private but I've been so successful with my Radio Work that my captain has recommended me for Officers' Training School. When I'll start, no one knows, and neither do I.

Although my address is Camp Murphy, I am never there. At present, I'm on active duty, battling subs from the coast. My job is to keep communications between Coast Artillery Positions clear. Also to repair any broken telephones and radios. Am I personally armed? Oh yes! Your little boy still is quite the hot-head. Wish I could tell you more  -  but my letter might be censored the I would be in a h- of a fix.

How is Miss Kain? The last time I saw her was at the Senior Ball. Like a big sissy that I am, a big lump comes to my throat every time I think of the fun and the things I got away with at N.S.T.C.

My love life? Well you know how soldiers are, here today, gone tomorrow. At this momemnet I am preparing to leave for my post 12PM-6AM.

So-

Be true to me

Your boy  -  

Al
