Dear Miss Thompson, 

	Well, I started my second week of school today. Just think of it, last May when we left Newark we didn't know where we would end up + now Walt Flint and I are at Pittsburgh going to school. 
	It felt like old times when I was registering for school. The only difference with starting school is that here we start school at 7:30 AM + we can't be late or get late slips from Mrs. Denny. If we are late we get demerits and a certain amount of demerits will get you thrown out of the program. 
	They (The Army) manage to get us up at 6 AM and keep us busy all day long. My courses are Algebra, Physics, Chemistry, History, English, Geography, Physical Ed. + Military. For the [illegible] of all students + faculty alike, my Geography course is Economic Geography, the same one I had with Miss Barber in my Freshman year. I sent home for all my notes that I had. 
	I have 36 hours of class, Phys Ed and Military included, and 16 hours of study classes. 
	Studying at night isn't compulsory but if anyone wants to succeed he has to study. 
	I think the enclosed article will interest all as it is about [Ferd Smilari?]. Post it on the board so all can see what Newark State is doing. 
	I just got bad news, we're starting to get up at 5:30 AM instead of 6 AM starting tomorrow. They can't do this to us but they will. 
	Well, that's all for now  -  
	Tell Mrs. Smith she owes me a letter. Regards to all the faculty and students. Write soon.

                                                                       Cecil
