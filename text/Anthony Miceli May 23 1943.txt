Dear Nancy,

	I received your letter this past week and was really glad to get some news from school.
	I really don't know how my address could be listed as Air Cadet- actually I am not, nor have I ever been in the cadets. My present rating is that of Staff Sergeant. I have had this rating since February.
	Last March I was sent to Midland, I remained at Midland til January 4 of this year. Winter had already set in and we thought we were at the North Pole. The weather is unpredictable. Three weeks ago it was 101%, the next day it rained and the day after that [almost illegible] we had snow flurries.
	I had my last furlough in August and it seems time enough for me to get another. I think that they will grant me a 15 day furlough starting June15th.
	I am sure that if you have read this for that you are quite a expert at deciphering codes.
	My address has been changed several times since I was in the 487[th]. Just the day before yesterday I was transferred again. I am now in the 1108[th] B.T.S.  Childress, Texas. 

	
				Thank you for writing 

				Anthony Miceli.
