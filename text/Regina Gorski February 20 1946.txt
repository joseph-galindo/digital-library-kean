My Dear Miss Thompson:

Hello. I trust you are as busy as ever.

Will you please extend my regards to all of my friends. Just received the "Camp News" and was elated. Next to "Yank" it always rated with me.

Had occasion to meet som "NJSTC-ites." One of them Paul Saul was calling home at the telephone center where in addition to Uncle's clain on my time from 8 to 5 I also worked from 6 to 12, for Bell Telephone here. In similar manner I met Ted Gabry here.

Regret not being able to attend homecoming. Of all times to land in a hospital this was it. Everytime I managed to find time for a pass something always came up. This time I came down  -  no strange malady  -  just syncope due to nosebleeds. Will gave an EEG done. Hope this will not detain me. Will be up for separation in a month so I may as well have these tests done now as I know I will have to submit to them eventually on account of being hospitalized for concussion last year. The army is so thorough you know, in the separation physical that it makes it extremely difficult to enter civilian life.

I will look forward to the next Camp News and all about the homecoming.

So here's to your good health and probably a word from you when your precious time permits. Thank you again for remembering a W.AC on Christmas. I think you are very kind and thoughtful.

Most Sincerely

Regina S. Gorski
