Monday

Dear Aunt Nancy,

I see that you still have my EM serial number. My new one (Not necessary for letter mailed in the U.S. to anyone in the U.S.) is 0-1004578.

You apparently go the wrong impression of the denizens of this state-Rural did you say. Nuts: All the vices in the book and a few others are common practice around here. If this is what happens to a Jerseyman when he leaves Jersey. I'm coming home.

I've just returned from three weeks in Saratoga, a smaller community deeper in the wilds of Wyo. Back up in the Mts., about two miles up, we have a lumber camp and there I went for experience. All that I enjoyed was the skiing. I learned to menipulate the damn things and bought a pair of my own. Now I'm  back in Douglas with skiis and no skii run. Maybe someday I can buy a ticket on those weekend trips that Bamberger used to run up to Massachussets (How the hell do you spell that states name?)

All else is in its same stagnant state. For the third time I've applied for active duty. No doubt I'll get another rejection. That's life.

Thanks for the boost in the school `Blurb'. Give my best to all the nice people.

Uldric
