Mrs. Arthur Bowman, Sr. to Dr. Vaughn-Eames-----Copy.

Nov. 7[th], 1945

Thank you so very much for writing me, I certainly appreciate your prayers as I feel that if it were not for the prayers of the Lord's people, to give us strength, we could scarcely be able to carry on.

I am very sorry to tell you that we have had definite news from Washington that Arthur was killed on Oct. 3, 1945, in a plane crash; as we understood from Arthur, he was doing very little flying after V-J Day. He was appointed Vocational Guidance officer and was so happy to be busy and in a line along which he was so interested. However, in his last letter of Oct. 1[st] he told us he was doing some flying, bringing provisions, medicine, food etc., also ferrying men who were due to come back to the States. They tell me the engine developed trouble, took fire, and the plane crashed into the sea. I have written to Arthur's commanding officer for further information as I cannot but help feel that all these splendid young men were the victims of gross negligence on the part of someone in authority to see that the plane was serviced properly before it was flown. Should this have occurred during combat, whether the cause was just or unjust, we would have to bow our heads and accept it, but now, in peace time, on an errand of mercy? Surely the government has lost faith with these boys and with us!

Our loss is so great we can scarcely bear it, but we are looking up to Him, believing that what He does is right, and that He will never leave us or forsake us.

Should I hear further, I will write you again. Thank you and all of Arthur's friends for their loving thoughts and kindness,

Yours in deep sorrow,

Louises C Bowman
