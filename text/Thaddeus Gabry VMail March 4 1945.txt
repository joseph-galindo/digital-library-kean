PARIS  -  4 MARCH `45

Dear Miss Thompson,

Greetings and salutations from Gay Paree! Starting as I did from Africa I thought I'd never get here. It's a wonderful city from any angle and I've managed to view it from just about every angle. Believe it or not I'm in school again  -  This time to learn how to teach. Sounds crazy but after V-E day the schooling of our soldiers will be item No. 1 and it looks as if I'll be tied up in some I.A. work right over here. Suits me to a T though.

Please say hello to the old crowd for me. See what a trip Mr. Hutchinson lost out on by not getting in my outfit?

Sincerely,

Ted
