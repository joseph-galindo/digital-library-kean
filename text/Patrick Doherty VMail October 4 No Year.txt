Dear Miss Thompson:

Bueno sera! This by way of introduction, is to let you know that I have quit the climes of Afrique du Nord and am now reposing in sunny (?) Italy. The question mark after sunny is the result of the rain we have had for the greater part of a week. Since our arrival here I have seen Naples but I am not yet ready to die, in compliance with the old saying. 

Miss Thompson, if it would not be too troublesome, I would like to receive a list of any or all Industrial Arts books on projects, techniques and methods. Please include author's name, publishing house and cost. I prefer to learn about those books which have been published since 1941.

Regards to all

What is the address of Bruce Publishing Company?

Pat
