From Clarence Wilson

I was on my way across suring the holidzys, spent Xmas and New Years aboard ship and its not my idea of a place to celebrate those festive days
This is a beautiful place but the people are poor and war weary and its rather depressing. But for thousands of us itmreally brings out the fact that dear old U.S.A. is the finest place we'll ever know. Have slept in all kinds of places and had new experiences since my last visit in N.S.T.C. Hope I can tell you all about it some day when I can drop around again. We are sitting around our wee fireplace now writing by light from it and from the lamp we bought in town a few days ago Home is a goathouse on a large and old estate
Eat out of mess-kits in the open. Still rather cold here but no frost. Saw such a beautiful sunset this evening thought it too bad that such sheer beauty be spoiled by people at war. Could you round up a few of those beauties at school and send them over here to enjoy such things with us?
