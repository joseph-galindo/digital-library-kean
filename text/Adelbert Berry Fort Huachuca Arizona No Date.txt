FORT HUACUCA, ARIZONA

Dear Sir,

I want to thank you for your help in preparing the other fellows and myself for this life.

We enjoyed the trip to Fort Dix and the many interesting things that happened upon our immediate arrival.

I was separated from the group at the first examination room May 15[th], but I had opportunity to see most of them a few times before I was shipped out here. 

This camp is under the command of the 92 Division. It is entirely composed of negro troops and officers. There are also a few white officers in the higher brackets.

I am attached to the Services of Supply. My unit is the 37[th] Special Service Company. We are the morale builders for troops overseas in rest areas.

The training program is so short that there is no opportunity for advancement. Each man is given a definitive job to do. I am going to be a motion picture projectionists, this is a very important job that has no stripes at all attached. I was very disappointed to find this out, but latter I met men who had already finished college, and had their degree in the same job as mine.

The job of our company is to provide entertainment for the men over there. We will go over at the end of our technical training. Our basic training lasts 4 weeks, and our technical 22 weeks.

The climate out here is very hot, everyone has a tendency toward being tired and sleepy if they are not doing something; therefore, we are kept busy at all times.

Our camp is 4,963 feet above sea level, and at first some of the boys had difficulty in becoming acclimatized, but now most of them are okay. Mountains completely surround the post, and provide everlasting beauty, and interest, even if they are filled with snakes.

I will be back some day to tell you all about it.

Sincerely,

Dell Berry
