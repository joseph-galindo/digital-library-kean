Dear Dr. Shea

	This letter was to have been written many weeks ago but I just didn't get time to write as you can probably imagine.
	I am in photography school here at Lowry Field.  It is a wonderful course.  The school building itself is of modern design and all furnishings are mordern including the labs.  They are really sensational, all stainless steel furnishing + the best of equipment.  An example of this let me sight the three thousand dollar enlarger.
	How is the year book coming?  I have some new ideas on taking and processing the pictures to be used for reproduction.  If you are interested let me know and I will pass on the information.  
	Denver is really a soldiers city.  The people here are wonderful to the men in service.  A fellow can really be kept busy on his "off" time.  As an example-Last Sun. a friend of mine from Ohio + I went to a dance at 2:30 pm.  At 5:30 pm. we went to a Sorority musical + buffet supper at a Dr. Ellis' home.  Thanksgiving we went to a civilians home for dinner after which we took a trip to the mountains.  Not bad for being here just two weeks.  Lowry Field it self is wonderful.  The fellows call it the country club of the Air Corps.  From our Bks. we can see the beautiful snow covered peaks of the Rockies in the distance.  Sixty to seventy five miles south, on a clear day, we can see Pikes Peak.  I had hopes of getting to Pikes Peak but from what I can gather the roads are closed for the winter.  

						That's all for now,
						Sincerely
						Robert Keappel
