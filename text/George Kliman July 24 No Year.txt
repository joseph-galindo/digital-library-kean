[Squadron No.]	[Condition] 			[Description of Troubles]

Dear Miss Thompson,

	I am now back at my desert air base once again, and am busily making up for lost time.
	It certainly was a deep pleasure to me that I was able to return to college to see my friends and close associates. As much as I hated to leave, there was the realization that I still have my part to play in this war, no matter how small that share may seem in my eyes. I was very sorry that I missed seeing Mr. Singer, Mr. Hutchinson and many of the other swell people that really made up our college, and helped give it a good name. But definitely, your name included. I know that my school days are over temporarily... But my thoughts are only of the present, and how I can aid in quickening the verdict of this world conflict. 
	Althought I;m still in Nevada for the present, I have the feeling that my squadron will soon be on the move again. In that case, you can be assured that I shall continue to inform you of my whereabouts if and when possible. You have my sincere wishes for your good health, welfare and happiness. This hold true fir the college faculty too. To the students of the coming September semester comes my best wishes for successfulstudy  and learning in the modes of a new world.

							On a wing with a prayer,

						     George Kliman- Class of June 1942
