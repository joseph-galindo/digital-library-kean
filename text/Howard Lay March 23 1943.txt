Hello Miss Thompson;
	A lot has happened since the last time I wrote to you.  Bob and I aren't in the same squadrons anymore.  Three Academic Squadrons were activated for the three shifts of instructors, so now all instructors on the same shift are in the same squadron.  Personally I don't care for the idea for it means chow formations, marching to school, and inspections.  Nuts!!  I don't like it!!!  No more doing what you wish and when you desire to do it.  The army has finally cracked down upon us again. 
	Thank you for the card and the "service Men's News."  It was most interesting to learn what the other boys are doing and what is occurring back at school.  I just hope you continue to publish this newspaper. 
	There is a very slim possibility that Bob and I may be able to land a furlough around the 5[th] of April.  If we do you can be sure that we will be down to N.J.S.T.C. to see all of you.  
	I'm very sorry to hear that the members of the "Reserve" has to leave shortly they should be allowed to finish I believe. 
	We down here don't have to much time to read newspapers and listen to the news commentators except to check on the progress of the war, so we don't hear to much about rationing, From my folks at home they don't seem to let it bother them or if they do they don't tell me about it. 
	I'm sorry but this is all for I have to rest, another formation or something?  Nuts!!!
						Best wishes to all, 
						As ever, 
						Howard
