Hello there!

One of Newark State's prodigal sons has finally returned to the fold by way of this magic V. He must confess that it was quite a journey tho'  -  this thick, steamy jungle especially. But you're wondering why I finally rose above these coconut palms and decided to make these few inky scratchings, Miss Thompson? Well  -  it's like this. A copy of the interesting Service Men's News somehow managed to find me among this vegetation and gave me a half hour's worth of real enjoyment (as well as nostalgia.) But it's not the receipt of the paper alone that motivated me  -  it was a statement I saw made about my bosom & staunch companion  -  Ed Gildner. The fact that he was the most traveled. (This is the Aug. issue I am refering to, by the way.) Now, that really made me jealous, Miss Thompson. Here he gets to see India & China  -  while all I get to visit is Australia (that wasn't hard to take at all). And now  -  the S.W. Pacific  -  the land of sweet enchantment and tropical moonlight  -  caressing breezes & no Dotty Lamoure. Now  -  you want the real truth, don't you? All right then  -  the land of heat, rain, mud, ants, chiggers, mosquitos, bully beef & luscious coconuts. Nuff said! Ok  -  lest I forget  -  my new APO#  is 928. Keep sending that great moral booster "The Service Men's News". I still yearn for the old haunts very much. Regards to Dr. Vaughn-Eames & her competent staff, to Mr. Sloan, French, & Hutchinson. My sincerest best wishes to you, always, Charlie.

P.S. Say hello to Mrs. Plenty for me also, as well as all the faculty. Charlie.
