Dear Miss Lipman  - 


	My new address is now Scott Field. This is quite a change from Miami Beach with its warm and invigorating sunshine. The weather here is quite cold and the air clean and crispy. I enjoy the air corp because it's a healthy and clean way of life. Above all it has taught me the true meaning of discipline and responsibility.
	As a flying radio operator, I shall get plenty of fresh air up there now in those big bombers. I never dreamt that my first teaching job out of college would fine me doing radio work in the air corp.Here's to good health and confidence in our ability for a quick but definite end to this war. Give the faculty and students my best regards.

						Yours for a good thought!
