My Dear Miss Thompson,
	I was truly sorry to learn of Ralph Sonzio's death. Ralph was one my closest classmates during my stay at school, and I hoped someday to re new our friendship after the present conflict. I just know that friendly fellow and all his talents are going to be missed terribly. I guess I could go on and on telling of the good times we had to  -  gether both at Ft. Dix, and during basic training in Atlantic City, N.J. when we roomed to  -  gether ----  but you know Ralph as well as every one in school knew him, so I would be just wasting paper and ink ----
	As for me, I am now stationed at Maxwell Fld, Montgomery, Ala. I was stationed here some fifteen months as an aviation cadet in pre -  flight training. I am now undergoing transition training on the new famous B- 29 super fortress. She is truly a beautiful lady, and to my estimation should and is living up to her name as, "Queen of the Pacific Skies." I am very thankful that I was chosen to train in these marvelous airplanes ----
	If my luck holds out, and every thing goes along according to plan --- I expect to be home on a short leave some time this month, before being assigned to an air force.
	I am enclosing my new address with this letter. It seems, you just get my address, and I change stations --- it will most likely happen again this time.
	Thank you for writing and letting me know of Ralph's death, I will try and drop his folks a line.
                                                                      As Ever,
                                                                       George.
