Dear Falks, 
	From the small sample I have [illegible; received?] at Fort Washington, I doubt whether I will have much time for little writing on anything else for that matter.
	The people around here speak more like Dr. [illegible; Tannsend?] than any one else I have met. They tell me that the ASD School is th hardest school to enter and th easiest to get out. That we are th most "highly selected" group of individuals. That for [illegible] of us, [illegible; mineten?] were turned down by [illegible] of applications tendered at different posts. Dr. Bingham drops around here occasionally. That way be one of th [illegible] or else. Dr. Tannsend's ghost is walking around here these days.
	Except for th soldering, this place here were Rah-Rah college atmosphere there [illegible; neuak?] and must of th big [illegible; time?] colleges I have [illegible].
	As a form of imitation, th Sophmore class paraded us across th [illegible] [illegible] to give [illegible] a [illegible; tust?] of [illegible] [illegible; mud?]. This after we had brushed and polished our shoes [illegible; three?] times that day. They then put on a swell show for us in th theater which [illegible] extremely clever skits and a class sweetheart, each class has its sweetheart who is same sent of a night club celebrity in Washington. We now have to pick one for an class.  Imagine th [illegible; sepencility?]! 
	I am [illegible; ivelnding?] th photograph. I hope th glass covers up th [illegible; nakedness?].
	For [illegible] [illegible] "nothing [illegible;Oefemts?] -- no committals". Time will tell.
	I've never been so busy!
As ever,  
Joe 
P.S. Happy Holiday on th New Year to [illegible] all.
