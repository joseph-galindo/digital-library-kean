U.S. NAVY

14 June, 1944

Dear Miss Thompson,

I received the card a while back but this is the first free time I have had to answer. Please forgive me & blame it on the Navy.

Things are going on about the same as usual but the term will be over soon and I will be doing some more traveling. This term ends on the 25[th] of this month so it won't be long now before my leave begins. I have off from the 25[th] of June till the 6[th] of July so I have 10 days all to myself to rest up for the real work that is about to begin.

You see on the 6[th] of July I report to Premidshipmen school at Asbury Park N.J. for further training before going to Middy School. I may be there one month, two, or as long as 4 months depending upon the opening in the Middy Schools.

I do not know what my address will be at Asbury but I will send it when I find out.

I have enclosed a small snapshot of myself & my dog taken at home in Jersey during the past winter. The one of the right is me, the other is my dog.

Exams begin on Friday of this week & last through Thursday of next week so I will really be stepping for a while yet.

This term my subject have been: Calculus, Navigation, Thermodynamics, Mechanics, U.S. Naval His., Abnormal Psychology so you can see what I mean when I say they are keeping me going.

Well, I just then heard "Mail Call" so I had better cloe this & go out to see how good my friends have been to me today.

Probably be down to the school toward the end of the month.

Signing off,

James Glaab
