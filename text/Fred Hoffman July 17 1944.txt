Dear Miss Thompson,

Now somewhere in France. We're really "roughing it" over here. Quite interesting but also a lot of work which means less free time. Haven't had any passes so far. ¶ Living under an apple tree in a foxhole three feet below the ground. Have managed to board up the side of our foxhole so it is not too dirty. A pup tent is ideal when you're on the move but with the fox hole how-soever we have a lot more room. 

Food is not so bad over here.

Can really see the ravages of war all around us.

Censoring is quite rough once here so this letter may be a bit chopped up. ¶ Can't say where we are of course but the scenery here is quite attractive.

Had the luxury of a cold shower tonight. They have rigged up a pump and a storage tank and an overhead pipe which have perforated tin cans tied to them. Water is pumped from the creek where it has been damned up for this purpose. Along with a burlap screen, shower board and sand it is quite the acrue in the line of showers.

Am enclosing a five franc French note which we use over here. So far I haven't been able to spend a franc. A franc is worth about two cents now. This French currency is backed by the Allied governments.

Well it's about time to crawl into our foxholes and get some sleep. Say hello to everyone at school for me. Let me hear how things are at school now, Bon soir.

As ever, Fred Hoffman
