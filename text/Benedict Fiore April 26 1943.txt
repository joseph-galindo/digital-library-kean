Dear Miss Thompson,

This note is more than a bit late  -  the billfold you folks sent me for Xmas traveled all around the country & rested for a few weeks in every Army mail room until just the other day when it finally reached me. Its grand & thanks loads.

I've been here at BTC #9 since December, doing physical training work. My wife joined me in January and on Jan 30[th] made a fine addition to our family, a seven pound scrapper, name of Robert Benedict.

I've no idea how much longer I'll be here  -  should move along in a few more months. I hope to take a crack at OCS before then.

I did receive the little newspaper the school published but none since that first issue. Will you send along any other issue published? Address me as above.

So long, young lady  -  keep me posted
