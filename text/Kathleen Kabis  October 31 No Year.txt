Dear Miss Thompson,
	Just a note to give you the latest details Walter's whereabouts.  
	He received orders for Pacific duty after he completed the caure at Ohio State.  After a few days at home we hath left for the coast.
	We had a wonderful trip stopping off in Chicago and Cheyenne, Wyoming, to visit.  After we arrived in San Francisco we had a week and a half together.  He expected to leave almost immediately so that extension was much appreciated.  
	I left Frisco on the 19[th] and he left soon after.
	This next duty will be aboard a destroyer escort.  He wasn't sure as to just what type of work he'd be doing 
	I'm sure once he's able he'll write you, but until then I thought I'd send along his latest address.
	The baby and I have come home to live with my mother for the duration.  So I should get daiin for a visit occasionally.
	My best regards to all.
                                 	Sincerely,
                                   Kathleen Kabis
