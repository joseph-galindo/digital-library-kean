Dear Miss Thompson;

Quite some time since you have heard from me, so, I must keep you posted on developments.

I have been here since Oct. 10, and am assigned to the low pressure chamber. In this tank atmospheric conditions up to 40,000' are reproduced. We take 6 groups of cadets up daily, 16 in each group. We instruct them in the use of oxygen and point out the physiological effects of high altitudes. Later on cadets will be classified according to their altitude adaptness. Quite a few have difficulty at high altitudes and will, after classification, be assigned to low altitude flying. 

Our work includes operation of the chamber, keeping records, and inside observing. Each of us manage to take at least one flight daily. So far I have notice no ill effects. 

My position is that of staff sergeant in charge of assigned personnel.

Frank Romano is still with us and has been made a sergeant. He's a conceited thing at times. 

Art Roll is here in Alabama. We plan to meet sometime in the near future.

We live in tents and have ample facilities for recreation, this being a post of about 8,000.

I am hoping for a furlough this spring. I haven't been home in over four months and my morale sort of demands it.

Best Regards to All

Sincerely

Ray Kowalick
