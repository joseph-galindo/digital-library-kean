Hello Everybody:
	Been kept rather busy sleeping off the dizzy spell that came over most of us. And I thought that I was a sea-faring sailor. Well anyway it isn't so bad, felt sick the second day out, then a few days after we ran into rough waters. No matter how large the ship was it sure did roll + toss + make us feel like the kids who fill themselves with hot-dogs and soda on Coney Island + then take a roller coaster.
	I certainly did enjoy being with you people even though it was for such a short time. There were a lot of things that I had hoped to accomplish but never did.
	It's been swell out here in the Atlantic had perfect weather + still having it. We had a few tense moments when we heard that U-boats were in the vicinity, but then we have had faith in the Skipper. This war time traveling experience is really some to 
		My letter may seem a bit too flimsy, but it's pretty hard to say something without telling something that may be censored + thus lose the thought of the letter.
	I'm perfectly happy, the buddies are swell + so are the officers, lets hear from all of you.
                                                              Sincerely	Chet
