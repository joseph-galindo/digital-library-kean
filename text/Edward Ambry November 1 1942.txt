Dear Miss Thompson  - 

	Just a short note to let you know you can add another name to your ever-growing list of men in service.

	I have enlisted in the Naval Reserve and am assigned to this Maritime Training Station as an Instructor in Swimming, Water Safety and Life Rescue Work.

	This is a new base and is not completely in full operation. When we really get rolling we will train 40,000 seamen, for merchant ships, each year. They will be trained at the rate of 10,000 every three months.

	My schedule will consist of teaching seven hours each day  -  50 men in each class  -  350 men a day  -  and I'm really tired at the end of it.

	I expect to get a day off in the near future and visit you people at college.

Regards to all. ----------

                                                                      Ed Ambry
