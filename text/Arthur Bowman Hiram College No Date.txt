Tuesday

Dear Miss Thompson,

Received the Christmas folder and new Reflector as well as your Christmas card, thanks for them all. Miss Thompson, it seems as if they still have me in the wrong bracket back there! No, I'm not ASTP- I am in Pre Aviation Cadet training here, with the grade of aviation student. The next stop will be San Antonio, Texas, which incidentally will be in the next week or so. Here we've been studying Math, Physics  -  etc and we've also had 10 hours or dual flying.

So much for my "status quo." I'll bet it was quite a surprise to the bunch back there to see Old Big come meandering back in civics! On his way back to Jersey, he stopped off here and broke the news to me. It was swell to see him, although I believe he didn't come too much for the situation he now finds himself in. By the way, you'll probably be seeing Kenny Muniz right about now, he's the happy possessor of a 15 day furlough.

Well, as I said we're leaving soon, so things are rapidly approaching a series of climaxes here. I expect to finish my flying course in two days or so, as well as our regular academic work. As soon as we get definite and on our next assignment, I'll let you know all about it. In the meantime, remember me to everybody.

Yours,

Art Bowman

(P.S. Hope you have a happier New Year.)
