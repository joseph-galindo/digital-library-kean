China
Sept. 15, 1945

Dear Miss Thompson,

I know I should have written to you before this but I have had my own perhaps foolish reasons for not writing. They are difficult to explain but maybe I will be able to do so some day when I come home and visit the school. In the mean time here is this brief letter as to my where abouts.

I've been in China for about a year and a half. Since I last wrote I have moved around quite a lot (on foot sad to say) in the course of chasing after the Japs and vice versa. At present things are more or less at a standstill but the situation is good, from our point of view.

I hope it will not be too long before I can return to the States. When that time comes I expect to visit the college and maybe sit in on a few of my favorite classes, if the teachers don't mind. I would also like to browse through the library, attend an assembly program, and tilt back a chair in the Tutor Room, (bad for the chairs I know, but good for the soul).

Along with this letter I am mailing one to Mr. (or is it Dr.?) Dix. It is in conncetion with his question in the Service Men's News about education in the postwar world.

Tell Mr. Hutchinson that for a while I was mentally shining up my Wilkie button, but now that the nominations are over I am in the market for an equally large Dewey button. If I were in his history class today, I would undoubtedly would be campaigning at full blast. Anyway, it is to the credit of the State of N.J., that they have already enabled me to cast my vote.

Does Mr. Hutchinson remember me?

Ed
