England
18 April 1945

Faculty.

Here I am in Merry Ole England with the famous Eighth Airforce. I did a little navigating in a B-17 along with hundreds of other men and paid the Germans a visit. In fact I have paid them several visits and handed them the Yanks calling card via various types of bombs. The Germans are really taking it and occassionally pass a little out in the form of flak.

I would like to tell more about what I see on the way in and out of the Reich, but it's the same old story, military information.

I received Mr. Sloan's St Patricks Day card soon after I reached my destination. Thanks a lot, Mr. Sloan for the "thoughts".

I know George Geller very well as we were in the same class. I certainly felt badly when I heard of his hard luck. Knowing George, I know he will not let it handicap him in any way.

Say hello to Al Dimico for me  -  and the rest of the boys.

Notice the new address  -  and thanks for the Service Mens News it is certainly a welcome item.

As always,

Saul Guritzky
