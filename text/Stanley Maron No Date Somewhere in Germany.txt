Dear Miss Thompson,
	I received the latest issue of the Service Men's News and enjoyed it as every issue.
	In order to get a better view of war in it [Illegible. Likely balder/bolder] aspect I transferred up forward to the [Two Black Splotches- Likely Censored] Division. That explains to change in address which you will note at the top of the page. I am now in a litter bearing platoon.
	Please give my regards to all and best wishes.

                                    	Stan
