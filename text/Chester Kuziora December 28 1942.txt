Dear Mr. + Mrs. Dean:
	I was looking through my year book when I noticed your pictures in it and remembered I meant to write ever since we landed in England. Had I to write to all my friends, at least two secretaries would have been engaged and then I wouldn't be able to go into combat except to sit in an office and answer my correspondence.
	As the old year rolls along and the new comes in, we find that the fellows are scattered all over the globe. You didn't have to join the navy to see the world. I find myself here in Africa, it was a great move and a successful one for us Americans.
	We've met with some peculiar but interesting experiences here. Our knowledge of French what little we remember from our high school days is blessing here. Anyway the Indian sigh language helps considerably.
	The French and the Arab are a fine people, to them we are a godsend. It seem no matter where the Yanks may go, they are liked by everyone for their [frolicing?] generosity, and amicability with the natives.
	Thus far I've enjoyed every minute of this army career. True we've had our hard moments, but then the good also comes as compensation.
	I hope this letter will find you people in the best of health, may the New Year bring you all the happiness + may we once again be all together.
                                                                    Sincerely,
                                                                  Chet Kuziora
