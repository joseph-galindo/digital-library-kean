U.S. ARMY AIR FORCES

Monday

Dear Nancy  -  

Just a line to let you know that the bright young chap who used to work in your library is still going his merry way. This time I'm spending the winter at Miami Beach. It's a bit too chilly up north and I wanted to get rid of my cold. Succeeding too. Not even a sniffle.

Got my diploma from Penn State in time to be accepted as an aviation cadet so here I be. Notice the "Put". I'm getting ahead in the Army inversely as the square. Getting lots of education tho both academically and from the school of life as she is lived.

Having a great time here. Lotsa sunshine. Swim every day. Coat of tan. Palm trees and coconuts etc. Nice place to spend the winter.

Drop me a line will ya?

Received your card and also Minnie's. Thank you for thinking of me.

I promise to write a bit more faithfully. No foolin!

Regards and best wishes  -    

As ever  -
