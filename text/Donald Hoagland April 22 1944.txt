Dear Miss Thompson,

As you can see I have a new address from the one on my last letter, but not for long. I leave here tomorrow, having been here 7 weeks taking a course in flexible gunnery, for advanced navigation school  -  the last, longest and most difficult phase of the training. So by Monday, I will have another new address  -  seems as if I spend most of my time traveling from one place to another.  -  have been at 9 posts in 13 monrha od Army life.

The latest servicemen's news arrived today and inspired this letter because I'm sure that at advanced there will be very little time for such things as letter writing.

Incidentally, my next post will still be in Texas  -  you see I am doomed to spend my days here  -  at least it would appear so. I'm still looking forward eagerly to that first furlough, when and if I ever get it. Can't possibly get one before next October so you see I have lots more waiting to do.

Nothing more of any note  -  homesickness is a constant thing with soldiers  -  the sun shines down brightly and plenty hot and the dust still covers the Texas plains and blows merily on with each slight and infrequent breeze.

Enough for now  -  my regards to any who remember  -  

Donald P. Hoagland
