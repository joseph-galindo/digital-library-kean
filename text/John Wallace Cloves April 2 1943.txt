Dear Miss Thompson:

It was indeed a pleasure to receive your most welcome letter and Christmas remembrance. Thank you very much. I will try to answer some of your questions. I was sworn in the Naval Reserve of October 29, 1942 as an Apprentice Seaman. (Class V-II) and put on inactive duty on February 8, 1943 I was sworn in as a Lieutenant (j.g.) U.S.N.R. and I am now awaiting my orders as to where I am to report. In the meantime I am staying on at the U.S. Naval Air Base here in Jacksonville in the Machinist Mates School according to all reports it is expected that I am going to stay on here doing some kind of work in the school but I can't say as you know the Navy, one can never say where one will because when you do finally receive orders it is just the opposite of what you think it will be. But this is the Navy. I am not expecting anything and I'm willing to be sent wherever they need me. Wherever it may be I promised to keep you posted.

I'm glad to hear about the rest of the boys in my class. It is nice to hear they are doing O.K. About your (unclear word) for a snapshot. I also promise that soon as I get a chance I'll send you one.

At present I haven't any news that I could give you about any of my classmates but if I do hear of any I will pass it on to you.

I will close now hoping to hear from good old Newark State soon.

My best wishes and regards to (word unclear). I only wish I could spend a little visiting the college again but I guess I will have to put that off until we finish this job.

Yours very sincerely,

John "Wally" Cloves
