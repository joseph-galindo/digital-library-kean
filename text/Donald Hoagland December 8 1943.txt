San Antonio, Tex

12/8/43

After 10 months in the Army and travels of a good many miles I ran into Vincent De Giovanni here in my squadron and from him received a copy of Vol 2 No 4 of the "Service Men's News" containing much long sought for information.

I've been here in the Air Corps from the start and was appointed for Aviation Cadet training in August. I took my college training at the University of Tulsa in Oklahoma and have been here about 3 (1/2) weeks. Since coming here I've been classified for air crew training as a navigator and will be shipped soon to Ellington Field for pre-flight training.

A glimpse of N.J. would be a welcome night after the months spent in Florida, Oklahoma and Texas  -  mostly Texas.

My regards to any who still remember me and congratulate Mr. Zweidinger for me. He's getting quite a family.

Sincerely yours

Donald P. Hoagland
