Dear Miss Thompson,
	Just a note to let you know that all the fellows are doing O.K. except Dick [illegible name] who is in the hoop with some sort of sleeping sickness.
	We were issued our uniforms and stuff today and also received our injections and it has made our arms as stiff as hell, therefore the scribble.
	We had out interviews and tests today also  -  I think I will get the Air Corps  -  I hope! I made 120 on the IQ and 139 on the mechanical appitutid. Louis Dykstra was tops in our group with an I.Q of 150 and a mech. app. of 149, some guy!
	Things are going at a pertty fair clip (someone is shaking the table) and we dont know how long we will be here so if you don't hear from us don't worry.

                                 Sincerely		
                                 Bill Harrel
P.S. My address is
	Pvt William E. Harrell 12134372
	N.J.S.T.C
	Co. C, 1229 R.C. , Bks 8
	Fort Dix, N.J.

P.P.S. Don't add this to your collection because it is so messy but I couldn't help it what with my arm and the shaking table.
