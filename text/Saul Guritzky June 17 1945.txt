Hello Friends,

Received your latest issue of "Servicemens News" and it was swell reading.

Since I had last written, the war in Europe has been brought to a close. And I have been making sight seeing tours of Europe and transportation hopes to Africa.

On one of the sight-seeing tours our "bomb load" was eleven (iillegible)  -  never thought I would ever have so much from navigating."

On these sight-seeing tours had the opportunity to observe our work from a very low altitude. I believe Germany will, remember the Eighth Air Force for a long time to come.

Mr. Sloan would have enjoyed the trip to Africa. When one gets into an airplane he realises that this World isn't so large after all. From England to Casablanca in about eight hours and that was going at a slow rate of speed, - if we desired we could have cut some of the time off that eight hours. Next day flew to Istres, France and then back to our base. Spend a day in France and really enjoyed every moment of it. Istres to England  -  time about 4 hours  -  Yes, Mr. Sloan, our world is getting pretty small. Any questions on the "Dark Continent"? Often read about some of these places  -  now they are check points, if you can see the ground, on long navigation missions.

Regards to all  -
