Hello Everybody,
	Once again I come out of my habitual cocoon. Now with the African Campaign ended, we find ourselves; the fortunate ones are enjoying their "home cooked meals." The others like me find relaxation at a convalescence hospital. All's well on this end, the Africa sun is putting a gentle tan on my body and the refreshing blue Mediterranean enables us to plunge in for a cool swim. Though this may sound too good to be true nevertheless bear in mind that the supple bodies of the soldiers need plenty of exercise.
	Why should I bore you with trivial matters, when I could tell you that this morning I tried to do a bit of hiking, didn't go to far as I became quickly exhausted. Anyway, you should have been with me to see the various ultra-modern architecture the French have put up. The homes are beautiful, native materials being used. I've taken a few of the various types of architecture representing this period. I find that I am at an end, so until my next letter au revoir [derchi?]
Write real soon.
                                                                Regards to all
                                                                          Chet
