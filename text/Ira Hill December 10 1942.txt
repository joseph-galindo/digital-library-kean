                                                             December 10, 1942
                                                                              
Dear Miss Thompson,

This is the first chance that I have to write to friends, relatives, etc. No doubt you were surprised to see Infantry address on the envelope of my letter; but that couldn't be helped. Five new Infantry divisions were started and I just happened to be caught.

Now for a little good news. The very first day I was made Company Clerk. I don't type very fast, but for this kind of work a two-fingered typest can get by. The only honor that I have at Company "L" is that I am the only college graduate and the highest I.Q. (138). The nest highest is 117. I am excused from drill, K.P., Detail, Clean-up, and Guard duty because I am the company clerk. My first sergeant mentioned that I would have my sergeant's rating in 15 weeks time.

I am still in quarantine so I can't tell you too much about Texas as yet. The chow here is excellent. The officers and non coms are the nicest bunch of fellows you ever met. In my barrack are fellows from every state in the Union. One fellow from Mississippi told me they spell Mississippi this way: M-i-crooked letter-i-crooked letter-i-hump back letter-i.

I am the youngest in my barrack, so they dubbed me with the name of "chicken".

The weather is very cold now. It has rained every day so far. I am going to get a 2 day pass for Christmas if I8m lucky. At school we kicked if Christmas vacation only lasted 10 days.

This is a new camp. The only trouble is that cigarettes, candy, writing paper, etc. cant be purchased until everything is organized. Then it really will be grand living out here. 

I am going to end off now as the captain is coming in for inspection. Please give my regards to everyone. (The camp is 14 miles from Paris)

Sincerely

Ira
