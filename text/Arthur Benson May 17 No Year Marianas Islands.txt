US Army Air Forces (Official letterhead)
Mariana Islands
May 17, 1945

Dear Miss Thompson,
	This is our "home" for a while now. We arrived a short time ago and although we haven't flown yet, we expect to in a short while. We have ground school classes before we fly an actual mission, that takes up our time.
	We are based in one of these Marianas- its generally speaking, a new base, pretty well wooded- right now the affair is being put thru the throes of civilizing this base. At this point we are in the midst of all the "comforts" of army overseas installations recently began. There's a common saying that is apparently quite true, that the navy moves in, gets comfortable and starts to work afterwards. The army moves in, starts to work and snatches an opportunity to build the place up along the way. There have recently been terrific raids ____ out of here  -  you've undoubtedly heard the accounts of them back home, the Nagoya affairs for instance.
	The trip over here was interesting. We took our own plane from California and flew it all the way. Of course every bit of it gave me no respite but it's a new feeling to make trips like that.
	Anyway, that's the situation up to date. Hope everything and everyone back home are rolling along. We celebrated (?) V-E day on Johnston Island  -  a coral postage stamp "somewhere" in the Pacific coaxing our field to yield to the ___ & ___ of our engineer and fly again, but soon we expect to have some real help as a result of that affair. Then we will celebrate!
So long for now,
	Arthur
PS. Forgive the absence of V Mail or Air Mail stamps. "Cest la guere ___!"
