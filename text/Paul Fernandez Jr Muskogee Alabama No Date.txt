THIRD WEATHER SQUADRON
UNITED STATES ARMY
AIR FORCES

Dear Miss Thompson,

I've just received that very welcome newspaper telling me the whereabouts and the doings of all my school chums in the Armed Forces. It gave me great pleasure in looking over the sheet and seeing what a wonderful job Uncle Sam is doing by spreading us out all over this world.

Can you just imagine what it would be like if we could all gather at the school one day and tell of our experiences during this unusual adventure. It sure would be interesting and ah yes educational in more ways than one.

Well maybe you'd like to know what I'm doing (or trying anyway!) to help get this mess over with, so here goes  -  

At present I'm at a weather station in the middle of Oklahoma, which is incidentally a weatherman's nightmare. One has to be an expert to forecast the weather in these parts.

One day the temperature will be flirting with the 70's and the next day we'll akk be busily shoveling snow.

But outside of that this weather business is very interesting.

Well I'll keep my eyes open out here and if I see anything of interest I will write and give you the details.

Things around here are just going on as usual. So in order not to make the letter too boring, I'll stop right here.

Sincerely yours,

Paul Fernandez

P.S. We work around the clock out here and I've attempted to write this at 5 A.M. so please excuse any mishaps that you may find.

Regards to faculty and student body.
