Dear Miss Thompson,

You will probably be utterly amazed when you read this letter, but I want to assure you that I had good intentions of writing before this but just never got around to it.

I was awfully sorry to hear of Walt Jackmans tragic death. He certainly was a swell fellow. 

I've been stationed over here at Columbia now for almost 2 months. On August 10[th] I expect to graduate with a commission. Dick Lowy is also stationed here but unfortunately he is billeted in another "ship" and we don't get a chance to meet very often. You probably from the experiences of the boys who have gone thru here that they give you enough to do to keep you busy 25 hours a day. Dick and I were seperated from Tom Bozley when we finished up at Drew Univ. Tom is supposed to finish at Plattsburg on June 27[th]. 

When we were down at Asbury we met Al Bashover. When we left he was still there and didn't know where he would be going. Well, think I'll say so long for now, give my regards to all.

Sincerely,

Fred
