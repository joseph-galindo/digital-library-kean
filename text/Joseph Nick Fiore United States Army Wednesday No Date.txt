Dear Aunt Nancy,

Sorry to be both brief & infrequent in my contacts with you but you may have heard that the one thing we don't have lots of here is time.

The end is in sight  -  Six weeks from today, barring accidents, I'll be a member of the upper classes!

George Weiniki has not been here for a month or more  -  I heard he was back at Benning, La.  -  Haven't seen Larry Wilson  -  probably wouldn't recognize him.

My future, I believe, is a toss-up between Special Services, AMGOT & possibly Intelligence  -  the former based on entertainment experience and the latter on educ. & language fluency. Be damned if I know which will get us over quickest. They seem to be yelling for more of all three.

All's well scholastically. Just 5 more exams to take over within the remaining weeks.

Give my love to all (the few) deserving souls.

Ever thine nephew,

(Signature illegible)
