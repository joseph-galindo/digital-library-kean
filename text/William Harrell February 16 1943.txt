Dear Miss Thompson,

Thanks a million for the letter  -  I really and truly enjoyed it.

Before I forget it the man at "Fartone" in Harrison  -  he draws all their mops, (illegible). If I remember correctly you must be having a hell of a time!

No I didn't receive the last Service Men's News  -  I would really enjoy getting one if there is an extra copy around. 

You might be interested to know that my marks, so far have been, 96, 90 and 38. Yes I said 38 terrible isn't it  -  but not bad considering the fact that it is a highly technical course that I didn't even take the other two were First Aid (90) and Customs and Courtesies of the Service (95).

I will try to write to Fred Hoffman if I get a chance but! My classes begin at 0700 (7AM) and end at 2130 (9:30PM).

Sincerely yours

Bill Harrell

P.S. What are Hatch and Richmond doing these days?
