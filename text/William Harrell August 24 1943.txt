UNITED STATES ARMY AIR FORCES

August 24, 1943

Dear Miss Thompson,

You certainly called your numbers right when you said that the fellows were getting wonderful educations while in the Army. Finally I too have been given the chance. I'm now at Mass. State College in Amherst and do I think it is grand  -  it's a different feeling than I had for Newark though  -  Newark will always be mu Alma Mater.

I thought I would never get out of Atlantic City  -  I don't care if I never see that treeless dump again. The trees and rolling hills are really being appreciated as far as I'm concerned. Home was never like this. They even have neon signs at night  -  can you beat that  -  after the practically total blackout at A.C.. Peace! It's wonderful!

Thanks a million for the photo  -  (is your camera still working?). I sent it home, it is the only one mother has of me, as yet. Now that I'm an Aviation Student (a Pvt. No more, thank God) she will really want to show off.

It seems as if every time I write to you I want something this time it is a few addresses  -  you are my writing portfolio! Was "borrowed" while I was in the hospital and I haven't any addresses  -  my memory is poor also. Would you send me the home addresses of  - 

Betty Packard  -  43 226 Pk St Montclair
Betty St John  -  43 93 Sagamore Rd Maplewood
Walt Jackman  -  43 + Navy
Mrs. Smith (if she don't mind)
Harold Atterbury (I hear he is in Texas)
Bob Clausen
And Ed Stevens 621 Palisade Ave JC.

I would really appreciate being able to write to them and I owe several of them letters.

Sincerely

Bill Harrell

P.S. My address is 

A/S William E. Harrell 12134372
58[th] C.T.D.
Squadron E, Section 108
Lewis Hall, M.S.C.
