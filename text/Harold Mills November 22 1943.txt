Dear Miss Thompson,

	After all this time a letter is way overdue. But time flies, especially when you are as busy as I am. As you undoubtedly know from various people whom I have been writing to, I am now at New York University in the Army Specialists Training Program. From what I can learn quite a number of us have been lucky enough to get into the program.
	This is usually a tough course. N.S.T.C. was never, (and Heaven forbid) never will be like this. They simply throw things at you and you had better be ready to catch because you get only one chance to catch.
	Of course I am able to go home every week-end and which is really swell. I certainly hope everything goes well and I can manage to stay here.
	Last Sunday I saw Walt Bittman. He has changed address. So you can revise: Pvt. Walter S. Bittman 12205723 (over) [page end] 

   Hq. and Hq. Co. C.C.A. 
   16[th] Armd. Div. U.S. Army
   A.P.O. #412
   Camp Chaffie, Ark.
   
   He had a fifteen day furlough. I wonder if he is bound for overseas duty? Could be. 
   I was very glad to receive the Reflector. Its swell to hear about the activities at Newark State. Of course the lack of news of male activities is conspicuous. One of these days things will be back to normal though. I have enclosed a copy of our newspaper. It is produced entirely by the fellows here.
   	By the way, why don't you mimeograph a list of addresses of all the fellows in service? I for one know very few. They change all the time I know, but the mail is forwarded anyway.
   
   						Sincerely
   
   						Harold H. Mills Jr.
