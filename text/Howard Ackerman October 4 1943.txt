Stanford (Type of letterhead)
October 4, 1943

Dear Miss Thompson,
   I hope everything at school is as fine as it is with me out here. As you know from my last letter, I was at a S.T.A.R.U. at Compton Junior College. Well, I successfully passed all my tests, and was sent up here to Stanford University to major in engineering. Stanford is one of the big name schools and is really grand. They have every kind of facility on the campus imaginable.
	Classes do not start until Oct 11, up until then we are free to do as we please...
	I am writing this letter in the Hoover Library, donated to the school by President Hoover, who by the way lives on the campus. The building is one of the finest I have ever see, not only a library but also containing a wonderful art gallery.
	If I successfully complete the course I will be at Stanford for at least nine months. I certainly hope I have what it takes.
	I hope to hear from you soon by way of the Service Men's News. Probably due to changes in address I have not received the last two copies, am anxiously awaiting them.
Sincerely yours,
Pvt. Howard Ackerman
