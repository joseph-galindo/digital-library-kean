LAREDO ARMY AIR FIELD
TEXAS

9 June 1944

Dear Miss Thompson,

Well here is a letter for your scrap-book  -  written in a B-24, 8000 feet over the hear of Texas  -  below is the Rio Grande and ahead the Gulf of Mexico. We are on an oxygen run to see how we react to wearing a mask.

I appreciated your letter telling me about the services for Walt  -  I too can imagine what he would say and probably do. I hope you never need have another.

I am sending you a little addition for your (illegible) collection, I hope it isn't broken.

Sincerely

Bill Harrell

P.S. Its beginning to get rougher.
