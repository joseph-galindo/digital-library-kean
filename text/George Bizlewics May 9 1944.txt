AIR FORCES OFFICER CANDIDATE SCHOOL
MIAMI BEACH, FLORIDA

9 May 1944

Dear Miss Thompson-

Enclosed is a newsletter, showing a darn good picture of some of our activities here at O.C.S. The pictures of the posturized officer candidate describes too well the position the upper classmen had us in during our Beaver month.

Looking back on all this always makes a smile creep into my face when I think of all the funny situations, and positions we encountered during that month.

Ah, me, I'll never forget those hectic Beaver days, when we crammed so much into one of the longest month I have ever experienced. 

The time is moving along very rapidly now and next Monday we go to Bivouae on a field service problem. Here we'll encounted all the problems that might arise ina threatre of operations. The upper classmen have already pained a fierce picture of mines exploding in our path, tanks chasing officer candidate into the rees, and getting lost in underground passages. We're going to forsake clean linen, and hotel rooms for a tent and fox hole. Can you picture the stories and comments of the men after the first and second nights. That will fall under the items "strictly censored"  - 

Until my next communique, I'll say adieu. Regards to all.

Sincerely,

George J. Bezlewicz
