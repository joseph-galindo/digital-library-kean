Dear Miss Thompson:

Thank you most kindly for your sympathy in our great grief, like yourself, Arthur, to us, was just about all that we had prayed and hoped he would become. We are so grateful to the Lord for giving us the privilege of having such a dear son for at least twenty years, the government took the other two.

My heart goes out in deep sympathy to the other two boys parents, may the Lord bless them and give them courage to carry on.

I wonder Miss Thompson, if you would be so kind to send me the year-book should there be an article about Arthur, also the Service Men's News? I would gladly reimburse you, should it entail any expense.

Just one more thing Miss Thompson, I cannot close without telling you again how much Arthur thought of you, and I do want to thank you again for having shared in making the splendid boy he was.

My husband joins me in sending you our sincere regards and trusts to have the pleasure of making your acquaintance in the near future.

Sincerely,

Louise C. Bowman
