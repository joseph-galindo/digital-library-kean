Dear Miss Thompson:

You are really a dear! Your letter was perfect/ I couldn't wish to be more satisfied with a series of pictures of the home-coming. Thank you ever so much for taking the time to inform me and so promptly.

Can't wait until I am out of here  -  that is the hospital. Cant even pass an electroencephlagram  -  had to take another. Oh dear  -  and here I am expecting to be separated on Apr 1[st].

My regards to all.

Sincerely

Regina
