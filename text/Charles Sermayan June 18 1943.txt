Dear Miss Thompson;

I received your letter yesterday. I am glad to receive some mail from home because I seem not to hit the jack pot at mail call recently. We had a mental going over Monday and Thuesday with tests and interviews. I hope I make the grade because if I do I will have 5 months of college training at some large Army college. I tried to find George at the 27[th] training group last night, the officer in charge could not find him, I guess he is shipped to some school or went to town without a pass or something. I have been meeting boys from my home town, Avenel. The kid I fooled around with at home is stationed about three company streets away. We have more entertainment here than you have home It keeps a man worn out trying get everything in.

I wrote my mother about that book I owe Miss Rice. As soon as I find out if I have it or not I will let you now. I left some things in my locker in the boy's room before I left. Please see if the book is in there and there are some things there you can save for a while until my parents come for it. It was swell to here from you.

                                                                  Yours truly,
                                                                              
                                                              Charles Sermayan
