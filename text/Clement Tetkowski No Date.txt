Dear Miss Thompson,

The army has decided that I am to be a Military Policeman. I have, therefore, been sent to Fort Ontario which was built by the English in 1755, later taken by the French, who surrendered it to the English, but became American when the English were beaten, afterwards retaken by the English and finally the American regained it and kept it. It is located just outside of Oswego (pop 23,000) on the shores of Lake Ontario and now that the leave are turning all beautiful colors the Fort is as beautiful as one could hope a camp to be. The officers and non-com's are so nice that everyone feels it will be a nice place to remain for the duration. We sleep an hour more than at Dix and we are allowed evenings and Sunday free to go to town. The food is good. At Dix I made friends with a former Filipino farmer who was in America, a cook. Here I have made friends with a Chinese who taught his language to Americans at the Berlitz school in N.Y. His reading both American English & Chinese is enormous and he makes a very interesting person to talk with on many subjects. Before I am finished here I will try to get him to teach me how to write Chinese characters.

I don't know what would interest you. I don't know much more than what I have written already. I would like to know what is happening in school and what is happening to the other boys. You might be interested to know my barrack is not so far from a boiler factory that actually makes less noise than the sound in the N.J.S.T.C. Cafeteria or any Fine Arts class. If you have any questions I will be glad to answer them in my next letter.

Very truly yours,

Clem Tetkowski
