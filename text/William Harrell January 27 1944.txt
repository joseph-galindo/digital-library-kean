Dear Miss Thompson,

Not much time to write and must answer a lot of letters tonight so please expect a longer letter next time.

I was re-reading the last Service Men's News and was quite interested in the article on the "Bill of Rights"  -  I am especially interested in graduate work or/and a refresher course in L.A. Could you tell me more about it along these lines?

I'll try to write you next week or as soon as I get a chance.

Sincerely

Bill Harrell

*Handwritten note in pencil (Mr. Hutchinson: This is in your alley? Can you give me anything on it for Bill?
