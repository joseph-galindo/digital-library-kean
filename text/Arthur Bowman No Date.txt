So, I expect they'll keep us busy no end, at least with the volumes & volumes of material they have to work with, they certainly have a good beginning.

I was very glad to hear from Miss Ewald concerning the latest information about credit for Army course, etc. Do you think it would be a wise thing to ask for a transcript of the work that I did back in Hiram College? Thanks too, for the Servicemen's paper  -  I enjoy them very much. I'm sorry they don't come out more often because its just about the only contact, indirect as it is, that many of the "old gang" have with each other. It's almost impossible to keep up with the shifting sand of Army training camps as you probably are well aware of!

I'm afraid I'll have to finish up now. I hope you won't hold the appearance of this letter, (to say nothing of the spelling, etc) against me  -  I really haven't forgotten all I've learned way back in Newark, but its hard to apply all the rules as one should in this sort of environment and in this much haste-

But I promise to do better next time, I just wanted to let you know where another of your wandering boys has wandered to!

Yours,

Art Bowman
