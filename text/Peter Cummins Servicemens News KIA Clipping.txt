Peter S. Cummins, Jr.

The many friends of Captain Peter S. Cummins, Jr. (1941), both faculty and graduates of the college, were greatly shocked to learn of his death in Germany on April 18[th]. The War Department notified his wife, Mrs. Frances Snook Cummins, of Newton, N.J., that he was killed in action while serving with the Counter Intelligence to which he was attached. No further details are available at this time. All of us who knew him feel a strong sense of personal loss: he was a dependable and loyal friend, an intelligent and thoughtful student, and a man whose potential usefulness to his country had been so amply demonstrated in his short span of life that its recognition adds poignancy to our regret. Our deepest sympathies reserved for his wife who is remembered by many of us as a gifted former student of the Fine Arts Major of the college.
