WILLIAM E. FROST

Corporal William E. Frost, of Nutley, who graduated from the Newark State Teachers College in 1938, in Extension, after prior training at Potsdam Normal School in New York State, died in Lawson General Hospital, Atlanta, on November 9[th]. He was flown to the Atlanta hospital after doctors at the Separation Center at Alexandria, La., had discovered that he was suffering from a brain tumor, but the condition had not been recognized in time to save his life. Corporal Frost had been teaching at Nutley High School before entering the service, and before that was a member of the Morristown High School. He was married and leaves a widow and a year-old daughter. His brother, Fred Frost, graduated from here in 1941, and is also a corporal stationed at Jackson, Miss. We deeply regret the loss of William Frost, for we were proud to count him among our graduates.
