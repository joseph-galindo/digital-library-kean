Dear Miss Thompson,
	

	Thanks for the card. Sorry I haven't written before, but I just didn't get a chance as they move us around pretty fast. I'll be down here for a few weeks yet before I go on to school. I'm going on to Link Trainer Instructor's School. I can't wait to start.
	The Army is swell even though the training is pretty tough. I'm very happy that I'll be an Instructor as I think it will not only be good experience, but it is something I'd rather do more than anything else.
	Thank you all for that swell wallet you sent me, I appreciate it & think that was a wonderful idea to send it to all the fellows. It makes you feel good when you are so far away & you get a thing like that. Thanks all the students & faculty for me Miss Thompson, and tell them I send them all my best wishes.
