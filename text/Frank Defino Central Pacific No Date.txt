Dear Miss Thompson,

I got your card yesterday and was very pleased to hear from you. It's really nice to know there are people at the school who still remember the boys. I guess Doc Shea let you know I wrote to her. I did get a card from Ms. Sloan and Doc has written to me but I've received no letters from any other members of the faculty. I guess I will have to tell you what I told Doc. I'm stationed here just for a short time. As soon as I'm assigned I will receive a new A.P.O. & I'll be sent to a more permanent spot (I hope). When I get to my new post I'll be told what my work will be. We came over as a group of replacements rather than as a unit. Therefore there is the possibility of my getting into some type of work I like. Of course, only time will tell. The Army functions in its own peculiar manner and to question its tactics doesn't help. Next time I move I hope its by plane. I would really enjoy working on one of those crates. I wake up and go to bed each day with the sound of motors in my ears. It's music to me, noise to others. Say hello to Andy Sloan for me and take care of yourselves.

Sincerely,

Frank
