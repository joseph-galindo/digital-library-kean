FORT BLISS, TEXAS (Stationary Title)
January 26, 1944
Dear Miss Thompson,
	The reason I haven't written to you in such a long while is because I have been very busy. I washed out of A.S.T.P. after the first term, and was sent down here to Fort Bliss, Texas. Fort Bliss is an anti-aircraft camp. I am in the enlisted cadre pool, awaiting shipment to a permanent outfit. 
	Fort Bliss is located in the westernmost tip of Texas, right across from the Mexican border. In fact, I have been across to Mexico on my last pass, and had myself a wonderful time. 
	As soon as I am sent to my permanent station I will write again.
Sincerely yours,
Howard Ackerman
