Dear Miss Thompson,

Well I finally found time to write a brief note on the doings at Maxwell of three of your former students. I believe you knew that there were three of us here, or didn't you?

I have been upped again, this time to Aviation Cadet 1[st] Sergeant of the new class coming in --- its a heck of a lot of work but highly interesting and new to me. I will probably have around 200 new Cadets soon--- quite a gang.. And tell the gals that.

I have not heard from most of the old gang back at college and am quite annoyed at some of them  -  especially Walt Jackman and Mrs Jackman, and Betty Packard. I don't have the least idea why -- I hope I didn't say anything wrong.

My gal friend has just had her first furlough and is crazier over California now then she was before. I only hope to get the chance to see for myself someday soon.

We are beginning to have warm weather down here and it will probably be too hot to stand soon. I wish I were out of here before summer really starts, they tell me it is quite impossible then. I wouldn't know.

Sincerely yours

Bill Harrell
