Dear Miss Thompson:

Many, many thanks for the beautiful and thoughtful photo album from the school.

I opened the package Christmas morning and had the pleasure of reliving some of the grand times I spent in the very same places and scenes depicted.

I just wrote a letter to Mr. Sloan. In it, I mentioned that we fellows certainly would be lost without the kindness and consideration shown us by the folks back home.

Sincerely,

Sidney
