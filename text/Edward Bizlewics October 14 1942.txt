Dear Miss Thompson,

It won't be long now before we're on the move again. Our course is due to end about Nov. 1. Then it's on to actual duty  -  I hope. The course here is a pretty complete one, and by the end of the course, why we will know the airplane from front to rear.

To add a little variety to our school work, they have us go through an hour of calistenics before the start of school. We start school at 9:00A.M. and go until 5:30P.M. We ear dinner at 5:45 to 6:30, then we have an hour to study from 6:30 to 7:30. So you can well see we are kept quite busy most of the time. 

Al Cordasco and I came out to school last Thursday to attend a fraternity meeting. We were lucky enough to get late passes, which made things easier for us. Things at school certainly changed. It seems to me as if the halls were twice the width they ought to be. In fact, the school looked bigger than when I last saw it. It certainly was a thrill to go walking in the halls of old Newark State again. It brought back many pleasant memories.

I heard from George again, and I see he is doing swell. He seems to like what he is doing, but I know he envies me for being so close to home. Well, it won't be long before all of us are home again, living normal lives.

I'll write again when I have a little more time  -  

Sincerely yours

Ed
