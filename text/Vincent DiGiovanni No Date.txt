54[TH] COLLEGE TRAINING DETACHMENT (AIRCREW)
WITTENBERG COLLEGE
SPRINGFIELD, OHIO

My Dear Miss Thompson:-

I received the school paper recently and you can't imagine how good it felt. It was like old home week. I seemed to know all the fellows listed and was equally happy to know of their whereabouts. Keep sending it.

I'm now in Ohio but I won't be here for long. I expect to be shipped to "Primary flying" in about 2 months. Wittenberg College here, is a fine institution. Weren't if for the predominance of khaki, I'd feel as tho I were back at Newark State. I'm here to take Pre-flight training and that I am in bushell fulls! The Army Air Corps doesn't spare the hoses.

How have you been? Well as ever I hope! How about the old school? Miss Lipson? Are you still kept as busy as ever? Just don't lose that marvelous disposition of yours. 

My wife and baby are fine. If you could just see the little honey. What a thrill. My chest is still expanded.

My knee is just fair. That's my biggest problem, always worrying about being washed out. But old man "Digi" won't wash out without a fight. I'll show these young blades.

Lights are going out now but let me wish you the best of luck and health and keep a teaching job open for me. That's what I still dream about, teaching some day.

Sincerely,

Digi
