Dear Miss Thompson, 
	Just thought I would drop you a line and let you know I have changed my address again as you can see by the envelope.
	I have been here at Will Rogers Field for about three weeks now. Paul Sauls is here + John G. (I can't spell that last name) 
Yesterday I was transferred from the 6[th] Phat, tech. Sqdn. to Will Rogers Base Detachment Squadron. 
	What my Duties in this outfit will be I don't know yet.  I hope something to do with photography.  
   Okla. City isn't much to rave about.  In fact there is very little to do in the city. 
   I spent Xmas on the field because I figured the food would be much better here than in town.  We had a wonderful Christmas Dinner in fact all my meals here have been very good.  That is more than I can say for the other Fields I have been at. 
   I received that huge Xmas card from the college, that was really wonderful.  Thank you for it.  
						Sincerely 
						Robert M Keappel
