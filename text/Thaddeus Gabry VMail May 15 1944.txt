Dear Miss Thompson  -  

The April edition of Service Mens News has just reached me and as usual it makes interesting reading. There is little I can tell you of my doings because of the stricter restrictions put on our mail. Suffice to say it has become a good deal warmer in the past four days  -  and I don't mean the weather. Of interest to Mr. Sloane might be the awe-inspiring sight of Vesuvius in action. I have numerous pictures of the eruption and would be only to glad to send them if that _____ censor would give me the ok. He won't just now, but when he does I'll send them on. I also notice that Frank Pabst has at long last been located. His present address would be appreciated. My best to the faculty & any students, still remaining. I'd give one hundred dollars to anyone who can arrange to have the Mr.'s Hess, Hutchinson or Zweidinger transferred to my command!

Sincerely,

Ted
