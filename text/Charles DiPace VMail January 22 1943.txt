Dear Miss Thompson  - 

Remember me? I'm the "guy" who sneaked out on you last February without even as much as saying "so long". It was a rude gesture alright  -  so while hanging my head in shame  -  I ask forgiveness. Now that I'm in good social standing again I won't be afraid to come around those swinging doors and visit you when I'm in good "ole" Jersey again. Your Christmas card made a belated but rather nice visit today. It reminded me so much of one stanza of a poem a pal of mine wrote  -  quote "Somewhere in Australia where the mail is always late, where a Christmas card in April is considered up to date"  -  unquote. He was exaggerating a bit tho'  -  when he wrote it  -  as things usually reach us in two weeks or so. Up to this writing  -  I've seen a goodly portion of this vast continent & no doubt will see more of it before I hit those home shores again. I've been treated very hospitably by the people here  -  altho' I did have a bit of difficulty trying to understand them at first. Our Jersey dialect is really so much different. The monetary system also baffled me temporarily  -  now the dollar bill or the dime is just a memory and the pound note or shilling  - usually the shillings can be found in our pockets. My work is in the personel line  -  and very interesting too! I spend my leisure time at the Readers' Digest books like "See Here Pvt. Hargrove"or the Army manuals. A "Reflector" would be a gift from heaven. Regards to the council & gang. I can't ever forget N.S.T.C. & company. My sincere regards, Charles.

P.S. Write me all about the goings on at Newark State  -  ok! Charles.
