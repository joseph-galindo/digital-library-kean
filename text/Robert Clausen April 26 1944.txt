Dear Miss Thompson,

It is hard to believe that almost a year has gone by since we left Newark State. Looking at the latest publication of your camp bulletin, I see that it has been a very eventful year for all our boys. 

Since I visited college in February, I have made two changes, which shows the uncertainty of army status. When the A.S.T.P. program closed, I was sent here to an infantry outfit to begin army life anew. The infantry was a new life and, I must admit, quite a thrill for a college soldier. I felt, though, that I would like to do medical work as I had put in six months in the medics prior to A.S.T.P. Within a month, a lot of the college boys, including myself, were transferred to the engineers. I was given a thorough interview and have been assigned to the medical detachment here. I am very happy about the assignment, and I believe that I might be in for a promotion here. The outfit as new, and the good jobs are still open.

I can't tell you how much I enjoy the bulletins about the boys in the service. I think that all the boys must eagerly await the issues as I do.

After a year of service, I am more anxious to teach than ever. When this war is won, you may look for my slight frame through the door of good old Newark State. I certainly am proud of it, and I want to be a credit to it. There's so much that will have to be done after this war, and I want to be right in the thick of it. Education has come to mean everything to me.

Miss Barber promised me a letter. I suppose I should write first, but I guess the old excuse of lack of time must be used again. Perhaps if you could tell her that I have first-hand facts about geography of Mississippi, she might write. What do you think?

I'd so much like to hear from you if you have the time. If you want to, you might make a personal plea to some of my faculty friends. Mail means so much.

My Best Wishes to Everyone,

Bob Clausen
