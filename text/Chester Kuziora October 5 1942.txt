Dear Miss Thompson:
	I really can't express my appreciation and happiness to be here in jolly ole England. The hospitality shown us was beyond our imagination. The people and soldiers were swell to us, sharing their tea and biscuits and we in return share our chocalates and cigarettes. (American of course).
	To see the rolling green hills, spotted with villages here and there, clean cut homes, [Entire line blacked out] is really undescribable.
	The narrow streets in some of those hamlets bring back to me the stories by Charles Dickens. All in all, I can say without preduice, our boys like it here, so please don't believe any other stories that you may hear (probably more Nazi propaganda). 
	I do hope we'll be able to get a few books. I hate to pester to you people, but if you have the time and opportunity, I sure would appreciate a few of the recent old Books-of-the-month. There's one in particular "Stories From the New Yorker" and another from the Reader's Digest. In closing, I sure would like to hear from all of you either by V mail or Air Mail. Best of Luck to all of you.		
                                                                    Sincerely	
                                                                    		Chet
