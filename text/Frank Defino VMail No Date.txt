The above will be my address until further notice. How long I'll be here is just as indefinite as any other place I've been. In two months now I've moved 5 times so you figure it out. Never thought I'd live to see the time I could live out of a bag for months. These islands and the ones to which we go from here will go, or shall I say have gone, down in history. I'll write again when I've become a little more settled. Keep sending those newspapers. They're great.

Sincerely,
Frank
