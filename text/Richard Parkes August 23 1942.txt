Dear Mr. Hutchinson: 
	I have been doing some traveling since I last wrote to you from Miami Beach. 
	I spent just two weeks their, and instead of having eighteen days basic training, I had only seven days.  We worked hard, but did get a great deal out of it. 
	I am now at Lawry field, in Denver Colorado for the next twelve weeks, and will be going to school here. I will be able to tell more about my studies later on.  All that I know now is that starting tonight I will be in photographers school until the middle of November. My classes will be from eleven o'clock at night until seven in the morning, followed by an hour of exercises and the[n] breakfast before going to bed. 
	Everything out here works on a twenty four hour basis, and I just wrote to Miss Thompson telling here about the life out here. 
	As soon as I have a schedule worked out, and know how this schooling is going to work, I write you and give full details.
Say hello to everyone for me, I miss not seeing anyone from the old crowd, as I guess all the fellows do.
                                  	Sincerely
                                      Dick
