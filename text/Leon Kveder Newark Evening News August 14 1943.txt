Air Medals or Clusters Given 14 Jersey Flyers  -  Members of Eighth Bomber Command Are Decorated for Combat Missions
	Washington (AP) The War Department today announced that 14 New Jersey men with the Eighth Bomber Command in England had received awards of the Air Medal or the bronze Oak Leaf cluster to the Air Medal.
	Lt. Kvedar, 27, who left his teaching post as industrial arts instructor at Alexander Hamilton Junior High School, Elizabeth, February 26, 1941, to enlist in the Army as a private, writes regularly to his parents, Mr. and Mrs. Frank Kvedar, but never mentioned any of his air exploits or the fact that he has been decorated.
                               With Clark Gable
For that matter, the Bayonne officer, who is senior flight commander of his squadron, to which Capt. Clark Gable is attached, seldom refers to the war in his correspondence except to express the hope that it soon will end.
	Lt. Kvedar's air experiences, however, have been duly publicized, especially his part in the air raid on Wilhelmshaven last May when his Flying Fortress named by him, "Sugar Puss," his affectionate name for his mother, was attacked by eight enemy planes, fought them off and succeeded in dropping its load of bombs on its objective, although the plane's navigator was fatally wounded.
Won Promotions
	Lt. Kvedar became an aviation cadet the latter part of 1941 after he won promotions in the ranks until he was made a sergeant and served as an instructor at one of the Army Schools.  He was commissioned in July, 1942, and has been operating from one of the Army air bases in England.
