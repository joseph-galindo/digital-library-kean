THE CITADEL
CHARLESTON, SOUTH CAROLINA

Thurs, April 29, `43

Dear Miss Thompson,

Just today, I received The Servicemen's News which was forwarded to my new address from Camp Blouding, Florida. I really enjoyed every word of it.

As you can see, my address has changed from a U.S. Camp to a campus. I have been accepted for the A.S.T.P. (Army Specialized Training Program). I presume that you have heard or have read in the papers that the government has taken over many of our leading colleges and universities and plans to send to them Army personnel who meet the qualifications set-up by the War Department. 

I've been here at The Citadel, the military college of South Carolina, two weeks for classification. Examinations in psychology, physics, chemistry, algebra, and geometry have been required for the purpose of classification. I have passed all my examinations and have been classified has(sp?) an Engineering major.

At present, I'm taking refresher courses in physics, chemistry, mathematics, and military science, and expect to leave for one of the A.S.T.P. colleges or universities before May tenth.

My sincere regards to all at Newark State!

Sincerely,

John Calcerano
