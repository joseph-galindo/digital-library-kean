Dear Miss Thompson: 
	Time, she do fly!  When there is so little of it, and when one can't find days long enough, time becomes meaningless. Well that's what has happened to me, and my correspondence has fallen way back with every-one. 
	Graduation took place last Saturday morning and I never realized the great difference between a military graduation and a civilian one.  Much to my arrangement I was graduated fourth in the class of one hundred and eighty students. This made me feel pretty good, and to top everything off, I've been made an instructor out here. The men in my class range in age from eighteen to forty seven.  It's quite a bit more different than it was in civilian life.  
	About two weeks ago I bumped into a fellow, and when I looked up to excuse myself, I was face to face with Bob Kalpple!  He looks very well and we were both so surprised we couldn't say anything for a moment.  He is out here for photography also, and has probably written you about it.  He had with him a ["reflector"] and it sure was good to read that paper again  -  it is the first one that I have seen since I left school. Is the reflector staff going to send copies to us fellows in the service?  I ask, because I know that there was some discussion about this.  I'd love to have a copy when it comes out again, or better still, all the copies of this fall.  Any chance? 
	The weather is perfectly beautiful here, and I like this section of the country more and more each day.  
	Furloughs are just about frozen, but I am still trying to convince the staff out here that my see some [familiar] faces would be good for me! As ever Dick
