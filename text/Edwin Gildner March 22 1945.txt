Dear Miss Thompson,

By now you are probably ready to boil me in oil for not answering your letter of Oct. 27. Please calm yourself, because, honestly, I just received that letter a few days ago. Well, maybe it was a week ago.

I liked your rebuttal on my crticisms of the Service Mens News. I gather, your main poin is, that civilian morale must be maintained at all costs. I agree. In fact I am almost ready to permit you to further your aim by stating that "T/3 Edwin D. Gildner was awarded the Good Conduct Medal at an impressive ceremony etc." The only difficulty lies in the fact that I don't really know if I have it or not. About six months ago my C.O. asked me if I had been thus honored. If not, he was going to recommend that I get it. I thought the matter over carefully and recalled that my name once appeared on an official list. It seemed to me it was a notification that I had been awarded a Good Conduct Medal. On the other hand, it may have been a K.P. list, or an order for me to pick up shoe laces at the supply room. Anyway, I said, proudly, "Certainly I have it, Sir", and let the matter ride. So to be strictly accurate, you would have to publish, "We are delighted to announce that T/3 Edwin D. Gildner holds the Good Conduct Medal  -  maybe." I'm afraid that would unsettle my civilian supporters so we had better skip the whole thing.

Along with your letter, I received my first copy of the Reflector, in over a year. Thanks for getting the "on the ball".

Would write more, but I am about to be rushed to a new front and my mind is occupied with grave military matters. Besides, it's time for chow. 

So long,

Ed

P.S. Note new address
