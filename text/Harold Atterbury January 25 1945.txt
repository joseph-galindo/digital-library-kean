On a second thought I'll add another page & try & do its job up brown as I might not get around to writing to you again for quite some time.

Santa Barbara was very lovely  -  I really enjoyed my month in California altho personally I don't care for 5[th] echelon in-stallations, but the training was valuable and to a considerable degree interesting.

Unfortunately, the type of copy that would be more interesting to you is rather rigidly circumscribed at present & so I can only deal with platitudes & generalities & a certain of personal stuff, but knowing you for the forbearing soul that you are I know you'll forgive me for merely handing you this tish tosh.

How are our boys doing? There can't be many left in the states now. I certainly hope that most of my particular classmates decide to go back & finish up & then go on for higher degrees  -  my hunch is that whatever they get over and above a bachelor's is going to help them tremendously  -  even more than before the war.

Bye now. Regards to all - Harold
