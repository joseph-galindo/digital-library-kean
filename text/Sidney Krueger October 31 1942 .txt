Dear Miss Lipson:

This day marks my first month in the Army. Im happy to say that next to my experience in Puerto Rico, this is the second best period of my life.

Uncle Sam placed me in the Med Dept. hoping to make a medical first aid man out of me. Then I was asked if I'd care to take an exam which would allow me to attend Clerk's School. Clerk's School prepares privates for medical administrative work. I passed the exam and start school Monday. It sounds like a good opportunity.

Having gone to camp for 3 years, I immediately caught on to Army routine. The former is run along almost exactly identical lines. Only here I take rather than give orders.

Things do gripe me and a few hundred more fellows at times. But a little reasoning soon straightens out things. It's just like a classroom where a "brats" make it miserable for the majority. Only there the brats are "men."

Army food is something I rave about in all my letters. Where my appetite has sprung from I don't know. I never felt better in my life in spite of rising when the stars and moon are out exactly as we left them the night before.

If possible, could you get Seymour Gelbond's address for me? I'd like to write to him.

You will write to me, I hope, even if it's a post-card.

N.S.T.C. must be the in full swing now. The library is functioning as efficiently as ever, I'm sure. Are there many men to keep the Co-eds happy.

Hoping you write soon, I am,

Sincerely,

Sidney
