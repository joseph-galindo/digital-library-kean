PENN STATE

Dear Nancy  -  

Please forgive this prodigal for not staying in touch with you as much as he should. Received the Service men's News today and I agree. I am quite overdue in reporting.

As the letter head indicates, I'm now stationed at Penn State studying Engineering for the Army. Mighty tuff stuff but I'll manage somehow. State College is a beautiful little town  -  Very difficult to believe that I'm in the Army. Were it not for the uniform etc., I'd feel very much like a civilian. Living in a beautiful former fraternity house off campus  -  Lots of swank. The place is filthy with curvaceous co-eds which also makes this quite tolerable! This ain't the Army.

In fact Penn State has begun to "use" me as Newark State did of yore. Out of a clear sky, I was selected as chairman of the Engineer's Ball  -  The dance was held last Sat'dy and very successful  -  Received citations, ortchids, bouquets encore  -  (should be beaucoup) or should it? So I guess Army or no, I still get the jobs to do  -  Shades of bow ties and saddle shoes!

I'd like to hear from you again and I'll really try reform  -  

Regards,

Seymour

P.S. Thought you'd like another picture of your boy at college again  -  Pardon the blank stare  -  Hangover from the night before  -
