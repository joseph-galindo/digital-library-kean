My dear Miss Thompson:

My husband and myself are deeply grateful to you for having written us, and I assure you we will never forget the many kindnesses you did for Arthur, he often spoke of you and of the nice letters he received, he always had a great respect for you, and was looking forward to the time when he would resume his studies which had been so tragically interfered with. I should have written you, but my mind was so confused and after receiving "The Serviemen's News", I immediately wanted to get in touch with someone, saw Dr. Vaughn-Eames name, and decided I would tell her of our being notified that Arthur was missing, and asked her to kindly inform all Arthur's friends.

The news we have received since writing Dr. Vaughn-Eams is very sad. I am sorry to say our sorrow is so great that it can scarcely be born. We have heard directly from Washington, in which letter they inform us "It is with regret that I am writing to confirm the death of your son, First Lieutenant Arthur C. Bowman, 0-2068580, Air Corps. It been officially established from reports received in the War Department that your son was killed on 3 October 1945 when his plane crashed of Aguijan Island." Thus my dear Miss Thompson does the government dispose of our dearly beloved son, after a lifetime of hope in having had a part in the shaping of splendid manhood to carry on in this poor old world with high ideals and a trust in a living God; We are not bitter, for we know that the Lord has taken Arthur home to be with Him forever! We have wonderful memories of him, and are looking forward to the day when we shall see him again, and understand the reason for this accident. I have written a letter to Arthur's Commanding Officer, should I hear from him with further information I shall surely let you hear from me. Thanking you again dear Miss Thompson, I am yours in deep sorrow.

Louise C. Bowman
