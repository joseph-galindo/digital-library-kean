Dear Miss Thompson:

Greetings of the season, Miss Thompson. Just thought I'd drop you a short "thank you" note for the lovely Christmas card from NJSC  -  Didn't quite know who to address it to but then I know by sending it to you eventually all concerned will know of it. You've done a grand job, Miss Thompson, keeping all of us in uniform up to date in your vast address files  -  We all appreciate it!

You know, it seems funny that Christmas is only a week away  -  Being out here in this ridiculous warm climate of California in December just doesn't seem like Christmas weather at all.  -  `Course you all back East are probably cussing the slush, snow, etc  -  but oh what I wouldn't do to be able to wade deep in the stuff right now  -  as a civilian of course! Haha!

We here in the separation center are kept pretty busy discharging our brother Marines fresh back from overseas  -  But, oh me, its so very monotonous to go plowing through all these discharge certificates, not being able to find my own yet  -  But there will come a day soon. I hope!

So for now, then, a Merry Merry Christmas with the best for the New Year  -  Please remember me to all at `ole Newark State.

Sincerely,

LeRoy A. Bohsen
