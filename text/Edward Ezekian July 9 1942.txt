Dear Mr. Hutchinson,

It was very thoughtful and very nice of you to take time out to write to me. I know how busy you must be!

I keep pretty well posted on N.S.T.C. as Fred Hoffman keeps me well posted on what goes on. I also receive the "Reflector" every month.

Everything is under control as usual. 

I talked myself into getting a three day pass about three weeks ago. So I "sneaked" home and surprised the family. It happened to be their (my parents) silver anniversary and it was this special occasion that convinced the "boss" here I should get a few days off.

But I can assure you I'll make my business to see you the next time I get home.

It doesn't seem I've been in over nine months. Time flies around here.

Although my chief job around here is that of draftsman I've been very busy the last few weeks operating a portable 16mm motion picture machine. We show quite a few teaching films to the boys in this Battalion.

I spent yesterday morning setting up the sound system (public address system) on the Rifle Range for the Colonel. He directs and supervises all firing and therefore the sound system comes in very handy since he's usually out on the range from 7 A.M. to 6:00 P.M. whenever firing is taking place. It's not the easiest job in the world giving orders and directions all day long like he does!

I spend most of my time writing letters. For leisure I go to the Camp Theatres (four of them) showing the latest feature pictures.

I work from 7:30 A.M. to 4:30 P.M. with an hour and a half for dinner every day. I also have half day off each week any day I want and of course Sundays.

That's about all I can think of right now.

Please tell Dr. Shea and the whole staff there I was asking for them.

Sincerely,

Eddie
