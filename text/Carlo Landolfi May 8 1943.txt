Dear Miss Thompson:  Just a few lines to let you know that I arrived in England after a very nice and peaceful voyage.  As yet we are not really settled although we have received our assignments.  It will take some time to get adjusted to our new circumstances.  As yet I've not received any mail at all but I'm surely anxiously waiting for some!  It is quite early to write nice letters as I've not yet run into any thrilling experiences but as time goes on I'll have more to write about.  I've been over to visit London already, however, and I'm happy to say that I received quite a nice surprise to find that things are just as good as back home in New York  -  except for the total blackout that exists at night.  I visited all the places of interest and enjoyed it immensely.  I hope to get another chance so as to become more familiar with the city.  Please give my best regards to all the members of the faculty and friends and let me know how things are coming along.  Sincerely Carlo Landolfi
