Miss Thompson,

Have just completed reading the April 9 and June 1 issues of the Reflector. These were given to me by Lt. John Curante I.A.'41 who is assigned to the company to which I am temporarily attached. It certainly was a treat to read about the "old place". Seems rather odd tho for me to be reading these `midst the reports of "Civilian(sp?)" maneuvers sounding off over the PA system. However, I, like Charlie Singer, look forward to the arrival of the school scandal sheet. This plus, the Stars and Stripes helps to keep this slavetail aware of the rest of the world. 

I note in the papers that there was a general exodus of the male species from books and shops to the ranks of us K.P.ers and close order drill specialists. This indeed gives me the GI blues. All those women at N.J.S.T.C. and no men to protect them. Are you asking for or accepting volunteers? Count me in. Regards to all.

Pat
