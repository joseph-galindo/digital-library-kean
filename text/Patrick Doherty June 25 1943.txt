Dear Miss Thompson:

This is to inform you of my newest change of station. Am now in North Africa. The exact location comes under the heading of military secrets. They do however permit us to speak about the Arabs  -  a filthy lot  -  and the French. Oh, how I regret that I did not take French at N.S.T.C.!

Please tell Mr. Sloan that his "geography" lesson are beginning to unfold in a dream-like manner. It is a movie or play come true.

Give my regards to all.

Will send A.P.O. number when I get it. 

Pat

The APO number on the envelope is the one which we had in the States and which we are using until we get a permanent one.
