My darling Nancy: Specha sie Deutsch? Parle vous Francois? Yah, yah; I now speak a sort of international English. I had to start from scratch on both languages as I only studied Latin in high school, but `tis kind of fun even though $65 is a lot of dough to a humble private. Personally, tho, I wouldn't trade the extra freedom a private has for all the stripes in kingdom come. As time goes on it may be increasingly harder to avoid a rating but I've done right well so far! My abilities are recognized but so is my independence  -  tru la la la. When the war was on (ie. for us) I worked like a dog but with the cessation of hostilities I play hard to get!! ¶Nancy, my dear, this country is superlative and being a mountain climber from way back it suits me to perfection. I have seen women of 70 climb hills here carrying a pack that would break a GI's back. ¶Still sweating art PBI.

Bye now

Harold
