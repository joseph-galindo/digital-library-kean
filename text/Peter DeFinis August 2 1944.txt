August 2, 1944

My Dear Mrs. Thompson,

I received the school periodical on the former students at the college. It brought back many memories of the people mentioned.

Things here have not changed very much. My wife, the former Marie Falcone, from Newark and my childhood sweetheart, has come out here to live with me. We are getting along very nicely and are very happy and very thankful to be together.

Today I got the surprise of my life. Our station is getting some new personel that is to be trained as Radar Operators. The order reached me tonight. Joseph Hale(sp?), also a former student from N.J.S.T.C. is the one I am to instruct. It sure will be swell to have a fellow student here with me.

I'll close for now for it is just about time for my tour of duty. I'll be expecting more news from the school newspaper.

My best and sincerest to the faculty and to the students. 

Yours truly,

Peter De Finis
Class "43"
