Dear Miss Thompson,
	Having been a member of the Archery Club at school, I decided to travel in search of a tutor to teach filed shooting. I am now in the heart of England dodging the M.P.'s the same as Robin Hood dodged his sheriff. We had a wonderful trip and the scenery here is beautiful. Quaint homes and villages comprise the majority of the many pleasing sights  -  ( doesn't that sound queer?) Oh well! I sure do miss school and my friends there. Would like to hear from you.



                                                                    Sincerely,
                                                                 Bill Peterson
