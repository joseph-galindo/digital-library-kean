Dear Miss Thompson  -  

It has been some time since I wrote last and as you might have expected my traveling has continued and undiminished.

We got into the battle of the Rhine shortly after my last letter and crossed in the vicinity of Mannheim. It was several weeks later that I heard of Pete Cummings death and figured we must have been fairly close when he got it. From there we continued East to Heilbronn, stopping there a short time to put in a bridge over the Neckar river and then down to Stuttgart. May 8[th] found us still going near Goppingeu, Germany. We performed occupational duties for many months which gave me an opportunity to look over Narnbert, Munich and Berchtesgaden. Southern Germany incidentally has some of the most picturesque scenery I have ever encountered. Then about two weeks ago came the news we had waited thirty months to hear. We are declared surplus and are to be returned to the states. The only thing the powers that be forgot to explain was when! We are still sweating out a boat and may be at it months from now.

It's not too bad a deal though. I find myself with a good deal of spare time and Paris only three jeep hours away. The results are obvious; most week-ends are spent in Paris with side runs to Versaille or other points of interest around the capitol. Paris is fine but Newark has her fine points too and right now I'd swap places in an instant.

Well, keep your fingers crossed and I may walk in on you before the winter snows begin in earnest. My best regards to members of the faculty  -  

Sincerely,

Ted
