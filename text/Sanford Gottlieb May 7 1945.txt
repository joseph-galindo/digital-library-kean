THIRD AIR FORCE STAGING WING
HUNTER FIELD, GA.

Dear Miss Thompson.

I can't remember if I've written to you since my last visit. If I have all well and good. If I haven't there is no time like the present. Also if I repeat myself please overlook.

Since I was home last, about 3 months ago, a lot has happened. Upon my return to Drew Field, Fla. I was transferred to the Military Police. I was pounding a beat in the town . Mr. Sloan will probably get a kick out of that. He's been calling me flatfoot for a long time now. I didn't like that assignment, so I requested a transfer. They sent me to a replacement pool to await an assignment. After two weeks of waiting and doing details, I was sent here to Hunter Field. I was very much surprised that it wasn't an overseas replacement depot. I've been exceedingly lucky. If only the rest of our boys could have been as lucky. How long I'll be here I do not know. Whatever does come of this transfer will leave me with no complaint. 

The field here is nicer than they are in Florida, but Savannah is a dirty old town and can't begin to compare with St. Petersburg and Tampa.

I am working in a Squadron Supply Room. The same work I did at Drew Field.

Here at Hunter Field the men, ground crew men of all specialties, prepare the airplanes, mechanically, for a trip to the combat areas overseas. This is called a staging area. Crews of all types of bombers come here to pick up their planes and fly them to their overseas assignments. So it is an important job these specialists are doing. 

I am expecting to come hime on furlough the next three weeks. I am scheduled to leave on the 18[th] but one can never be too sure. When and if I do, I'll be seeing you then.

Regards to all

Sincerely

Sanford
