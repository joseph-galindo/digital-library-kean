Dear Miss Thompson:

Just a line to thank you for the copy of the Service Mens News. You have no idea how much I enjoyed it.

I landed out here a few weeks ago and I am having a pretty good time of it. I am pulling inspections on propellars on B-25 airplanes. We work eight hours a day and the rest of the time is our own. So far its very nice and I enjoy it.

Well this is just a note because I have to go to work in a few minutes. I'll try and write at more length later on.

Sincerely,

Jim Coleman
