DEAR MR. SLOAN,

THROUGH THE NOW WORLD FAMOUS "SERVICEMEN'S NEWS", I LEARNED THAT YOU WERE ILL. HERE'S HOPING BY THIS TIME, ROOM 22 (IF MY MEMORY IS CORRECT) ONCE MORE IS INHABITED BY YOU.

LEST I FORGET, THANKS LOADS FOR THE CHRISTMAS CARD WHICH CAUGHT UP WITH ME ABOUT TWO WEEKS AGO. I SHOULD TELL YOU THIS LETTER IS BEING WRITTEN IN ENGLAND WHERE I AM NOW STATIONED. THINKS LIKE THE REFLECTOR, THE NEW YORK TIMES (EVEN THOUGH I DID SELL YOU THE TRIBUNE AT TIMES) SERVICEMEN'S NEWS, AND LETTERS FROM GLADYS FELBER ARE HELPING MY STAY HERE TO BE MORE OF A PLEASURE TRIP THAN A BUSINESS DEAL. HOWEVER I AM DOING MY BIT IN AN OFFICE DEALING WITH RATHER IMPORTANT OFFICIAL BUSINESS.

IF EVER I HAVE TO TEACH A UNIT OF ENGLAND OR THE BRITISH ISLES, I'M SURE THE VISUAL AIDES ASPECT OF THE COURSE WILL BE CHOCK FULL OF INTERESTING MATERIAL BECAUSE THIS GREAT COUNTRY JUST POURS WITH FASCINATING THINGS. I'VE BEEN TO PARLIAMENT, WESTMINSTER ABBEY, BUCKINGHAM PALACEM COUNTRY HOMES, PUBS, THE THEATRE, A CRICKET MATCH, KEN GARDENS AND SCORES OF PLACES THAT EVERY AMERICAN HAS HEARD OF AT ONE TIME OR ANOTHER. MY ONLY GRIEVANCE IS THAT ENGLAND IS TOO MUCH LIKE THE U.S. I'D MUCH RATHER BE IN EITHER INDIA OR AFRICA. I MAY GET MY CHANCE YET.

SINCE I LEFT N.S.T.C., I'VE SEEN QUITE A NUMBER OF FAMOUS PEOPLE, PLAYS, CONCERTS ETC. IN A MANNER PRESCRIBED BY YOURSELF IN ONE OF OUR CLASSES. THAT IS WE ARE ALL YOUNG AND EQUIPPED WITH GOOD EYESIFHT. THEREFORE A SEAT IN THE GALLERY WASN'T THE WORST ONE.

SINCERELY,

SIDNEY
