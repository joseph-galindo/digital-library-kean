Dear Miss Thompson,

Well I have moved again  -  this time I am in a more civilized area but it is harder to get to a large town than it was to get to them from Victorville. My new base of operations is 200 miles north of Victorville it is Lemoore Army Air Base. I haven't done much since I arrived here except sleep and eat  -  and that hasn't been hard to do, after my furlough I really needed it.

Yes I did get a copy of "Forever Amber" and thought it was putrid. The entire book is composed of Amber's amorous experiences, poorly told at that, no wonder Annapolis Naval Acadamy banned it. I do hope you are able dispose of it, if you aren't I know several fellows that want it, despite my unfavorable review.

While I think of it would you send me Ninfa Snyder's (see Colgniase(sp?)) address  -  I understood she live in Los Angeles and I would like to look her up while I am in this section of the country. I think Miss Ewald has it.

I certainly enjoyed my visits at the college, they gave me a "lift" that nothing else did, probably converted me back to teaching  -  I still am not sure, there is so much more to it than plain "ability" or/and "certification", there is the desire to teach, the hopes of the future and of course there is always the financial end to consider. Right now I feel as if I would like to teach but I know I would be damn "choosy" about a position. There is a lot I want out of life yet, if I live through this. That too is something to consider, what will be my "mores" when I get back from overseas, that changes a person you know.

Well there is another load off my chest so I guess I had better wish one and all at the college a Merry Christmas and a victorious New Year.

Sincerely

Bill Harrell
