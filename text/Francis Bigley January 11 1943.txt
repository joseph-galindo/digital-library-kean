Dear Miss Thompson:

This letter is a little late, but better late than never. I want to thank you people for the snapshots of the college. They certainly brought back a lot of old memories.

I also want to tell you that the "Reflector" reaches me regularly. It's good to read about the happening of N.S.T.C. It makes you feel a lot closer to home.

Thanks again for everything.

Sincerely,

Pfc. Francis Bigley
