Dear Miss Thompson: -

Thank you very much for sending me the June issue of the Service Men's News. It sure is a treat to receive it. I've read the bulletin from cover to cover and even if I don't know the various officers & enlisted me, I feel I'd recognize any one of them on sight.

Say  -  how is Miss Lipson, Miss Lee, Rice? Is Mrs. French still at school? How is Mr. French & where is he? Tell him I'd like to hear from him. Is he a Dr. yet? How is Mrs. Vaughn-Eames  -  English teacher, Miss Ley  -  history teacher and everyone. Are Mr. & Mrs. Di'Angola still at school? He would enjoy it here. I've just acquired a bow and a dozen arrows from the natives. They use this to shoot fish and kill wild pigs. They sure are accurate too.

How is Dr. Schaffer? How is Miss Kain?

Yesterday we had our first U.S.O. show in to years I've been up here. I [illegible] believed this was such a [illegible] [illegible] U.S.O. Judith Anderson gave us a scene  -  tho much of Duncan from MacBeth  -  excellent. But one of her girls sang, danced and played an accordion  -  jitterbug stuff  -  well that took the house down. The men refused to quit clapping and yelling for more. Women in evening gowns look like angels. 

Lets hear from you. Ever hear from any of the boys or girls from my class? Josh Shor(sp?)? Ed. Pfeffer, Josh Flynn & some girls from Maplewood  -  Virginia something or other.

Hope you well

E Edward Tannenbaum
