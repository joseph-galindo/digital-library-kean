Dear Miss Thompson
	When I received the latest Service Man's News, I realized I should write you a letter.
   At the present time I am in the Combat Engineers, the fellows who make the roads + bridges for the infantry to travel over. Right now we are in our 5[th] week of basic training and still have 8 more weeks to go. At the end of basic training I hope to be assigned to some technical school for training.
   It seems quite funny that I'm takin basic training all over again after being in the Army about a year but that's the Army. 
   I don't know if I'll be able to visit school this term as I don't expect to be eligible for a [illegible] till the end of June and don't know if I'll get one then. 
   Our training is getting quite rugged now but I don't mind it very much. It bothers some of the fellows because a lot are quite old for the Army, 34 years or up. 
   While I was stationed at Indiantown Ga I managed to get home for three week-ends and I got a 3 day pass for the Jewish holidays from this camp so I can't complain about not getting home.
   This is the first time since I've been in the Army that no other fellows from college has been with me in the same outfit. 
   I bunked into Sean Bubel the other day. He has just been assigned to the 85[th] Signal Battallion.
   The Camp isn't too bad but it's to far from a city of any size. It takes two to wo and a half hours to Richmond and five to Washington.
   I visited Richmond last weekend and it seems to be a pretty nice town. The only trouble is that service men + women have to pay the same prices as any one else. 
   It sure is good to find out what the other boys are doing through the "News."
   How are things at college? Is there anything new happening? Well I must close now so, so long. Give my regards to everyone .
P.S. Write soon 
                                    Cecil
