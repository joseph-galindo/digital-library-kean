DEAR FELLOW LIBRARIANS -- 
	IF I MAY CALL MYSELF SUCH -- AMONG OTHER DUTIES I'MLIBRARIAN ABCA RD SOME 1,000 BOOKS AND IN MY GLORY -- DIDN'T SEND US MANY FIRST CLASS BOOKS WESTERNS -- MYSTERIES -- DO I FEEL GOOD WHEN I GET A CONVERT FROM ZANE GREY TO VICTOR HUGO OR ELLERY QUEEN TO POE.  STILL THE EDUCATOR AT HEART.  OFCOURSE I GET FIRST CHOICE OF THE BOOKS FOR REVIEWING AS IT WERE.  RIGHT NOW I'M REA ING FOSDICK'S "ON BEING A REAL PERSON" FOR THE SECOND TIME.  WHOEVER IS BUYING NAVY BOOKS IS CERTAINLY GETTING RID OF OLD STOCK.  B UT I MUST ADMIT IT HAS BEEN FUN TO DABBLE IN BOOKS OFTEN SEEN ON YOUR SHELVES BUT WERE NOT "EDUCATIONAL" JOSEPH CONRAD, EMIL LUDWIG, HONORE MORROW, stefan ZWEIG, SHAW O'NEIL, AND I JUST FINISHED JESSE STUART'S "TAPS FOR PVT.TUSSIE.  REMEMBER HIM?  WHAT A CHARACATER.  NO ASSIGNMENTS, REQUIRED READING -- GREAT BUT I THINK I'LL APPLY FOR A CBRESPONDENCE QURSE JUST TO MYSELF ABREAST AS IT WERE.  WOULDN'T WANT OT GO STABLE.
	WANT YOU TO HAVE NINFA AND MY BEST WISHES FOR THE HOLIDAY SEASON.  ALSO FOR YOU TO KNOW BECAUSE OF YOU MY HAPPIEST DAYS AT NEWARK WERE IN THE LIBRARY.  WISH I COULD PESTER ALL OF YOU RIGHT NOW MD HAVE MESS LIPSON BANL ME OUT FOR DISTRACTING THE GIRLS ATTENTION.  I NEVER COULD CONVINCE HER OF MY INNOCENCE.  OR MISS LEE TO GIVE ME A SH!
	DESIROUS OF KNOWING WHATS GOING ON -- HOW ABOUT BREAKING DOWN ND TELLING ME THE NEWS.
	BE AWFULLY GOOD TO HEAR FROM YOU...SOON
