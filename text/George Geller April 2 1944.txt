Dear Mr. Sloan:

As you can see by my return address I'm back with my outfit. I wish you would let the school alumni bulletin know so I won't miss any of the future papers.

There isn't much now, the boys went through a number of rather heavy actions but my gang came out much the same as I left them. Of course I can't tell very well because I have only seen them by moonlight since we have to keep to our holes during the day because of the shell fire. Its not overly safe to wander at night but still there are such things as chow, personal needs etc to take care of so we come out like Jackals at night for a short while and then back to our holes. We do an awful lot of sleeping of course and what reading we can find. Outside of that we're at a social loss. We're lucky in that the weather is getting better now so that the mud is drying. We only had one day of rain but since our holes are covered we didn't get wet. I've been watching the changes in the hills in front of us. Day by day they take on a new appearance. The snow seems to be melting on the crests and each day the white spot is smaller and smaller. Soon I guess the entire mountain will be a vivid green to match the grass on the plain. I think it won't be long before the bunch of us will once again be wondering why we cursed the cold. 

I see my paper is running out but in my next letter I'll tell you about a volcano I saw near Sicily that seemed rather angry. It is a sight worth remembering. Regards to all.

George
