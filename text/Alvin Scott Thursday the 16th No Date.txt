[EAGLE LOGO  -  "UNITED STATES NAVY")

Dear Sir:

It's been 6 weeks since I put aside my "civics" to don the uniform of the greatest fighting unit in the world today, the U.S. Navy.

The transformation has been a rapid one to say nothing of a thorough one. We now call our walls, "bulkheads"; the stairs a "ladder," the floor a "deck", going upstairs is "topsides", downstairs as "laying below", etc. It's compulsory to use only naval phraseology at all times or get "gigged". 

We have 5 subjects, Navigations, Seamanship, Ordinance, Damage Control, and Recognition Training. 

The first three are 5 hrs a week & the second two, 3 hrs a week, plus our cruises, practical training, training films, physical education and last but not least the 8-14 hrs. of drill. All of our homework is memorizing each paragraph & page word for word because we have exams in every subject each day in every subject that are rather extensive in scope.

Give my regards to every member of the faculty and those few men who remain untouched by the draft.

                                                                        Yours,
                                                                              
                                                                      Al Scott
