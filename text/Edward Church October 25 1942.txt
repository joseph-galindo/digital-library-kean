ARMY AIR FORCES TECHNICAL SCHOOL
LINCOLN, NEBRASKA

October 25, 1942

Dear Dr. Shaffer:

I finally got more or less permanently located for the next five months out here at Lincoln Air Base.

I spent about a month at Atlantic City breaking in GI shoes and receiving a bumper crop of blisters. I also had the unique experience of trying my gas mask in a tear gas chamber and then being told to remove the mask. Boy I really cried and cried but you certainly get a healthy respect for chemical warfare and your mask after such an experience.

I'm here for 110 days of intensive cramming which constitutes basic aircraft mechanics. The school is operated on a lively four hour day with lucky me drawing the 4 to 12 shift. After school is over we go out and have an hour of Physical Training until 1 o'clock. Then we come back to the barracks and wait around until two o'clock AM when we have supper?

I was finally able to make arrangements to have a certificate of my army status sent to you which should complete all the requirements for my degree.

Best wishes to all my friends at Newark.

Sincerely

Edward R. Church
