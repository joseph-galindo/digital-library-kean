Dear Miss Thompson,

Today I received a small package and when I saw where it was from I knew immediately what it was. I couldn't wait to open it and see the pictures. I want to congratulate you on the fine selection of pictures. I especially liked the one of the flag waving. I hope you will forgive me for not writing to you sooner. I know that you would like to have a picture of me in uniform so as soon as I get an opportunity, I'll send you one.

As yet I haven't been assigned to any special squadron, but I've finished all of my basic training and now I'm just waiting to be assigned to an active squadron. I think it will be in the very near future. Our passes have been suspended pending shipment. Of course this doesn't mean that I will be shipped but there's a chance that I will. Today 1500 men were shipped out and I understand that shipments are going out tomorrow and the next day. If I am shipped it will mean that I'll be on a train for Xmas. I won't like this but if the train is headed East I won't mind so much.

I can't tell you how much I miss school. I just can't wait to get back. I miss those days in the shops, and basketball games and those sessions on the steps near the gym entrance. I must close now and I promise to write more often and let you know where I am and what I do. Thank you very much for the folder. I appreciate it very much.

Sincerely yours,

Al
