Aug 1942

I received your card which was forwarded to me from Miami Beach, Florida. In the Army my name is Rocco but in school it is Alfred. Alfred is my middle name which I prefer to use in school (N.J.S.T.C.). In the Army however, I must use my proper name. I'm glad to tell you that I never felt better in my life. I'm at Long Island City attending school here. My address is on the letter. I met Ed Biz here. He's two weeks behind me. Here at school I'm taking an Aircraft Mechanics course which is 15 weeks. I've been here now for 4 (1/2) weeks. In Oct. sometime I expect to graduate. The schedule here is 6 days a week and every Saturday night I go home. Its to[o] bad I can't come home on a weekday do I can visit the school. I got a letter from Howard Fay(sp?) today and he says he us an instructor there. I hope I can get to be one.

Well I have loads of letters to write. I hope I have given you enough information.

Sincerely yours,

Al
