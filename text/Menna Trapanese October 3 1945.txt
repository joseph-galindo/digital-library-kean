Dear Miss Thompson,

Yesterday about 4:00 PM I reached my new station, Camp Upton. a colonel from Governor's Island (Headquarters) told me he was sending me here for instruction work, but when I got here they politely informed me that they had no place for me.

Now I'm in the Registrar's Office working on patient's records. I'm really sad about not getting instruction work, but there isn't very much I can do about it.

I can't say much, Miss Thompson, but the more of the army I see, the more corrupt becomes the "picture." However, it can't last much longer, I hope.

Respectfully yours,

Menna Trapanese
