Dear Miss Thompson
	"And hello Everybody".
	I'm terribly sorry that I didn't write sooner, the time element here is very precious. I do hope you'll understand. I received your wonderful Christmas card a few days after Christmas and regret to inform you that I haven't received neither you nor the college's gifts as yet  -  however I do have my fingers crossed for the best. I did get the "New Yorker" from the cafeteria, it certainly is humorous, now + then when we wish to laugh, we pick it up even though we may be feeling blue or nervous.
	For a long time, I've been trying to have a few rolls of my film developed, those that will pass the censor are here enclosed, the others, I'll keep until I should "ever" get home.
	No matter how big this earth may be, it still is a very small place. I've met many of my friends here. Some of them; I've only had a chance to talk to for a few minutes and then go our way, "C'est la guerre" as the French would say it.
	Our morale is high, thanks to you folks back home. It may be tough going but we know you people are one hundred percent in back of us.
	I must end now as there's much work to be done + so little time to do it in. Best of luck to all of you, and please do write.
                                                          As Ever. Chet.
