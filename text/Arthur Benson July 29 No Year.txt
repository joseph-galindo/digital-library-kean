Dear Miss Thompson-

It seems that this note may be long overdue, but perhaps it's because time here has a tendency to cease moving. Or it appears that way.

By here, I refer to Guam, from which I'm flying missions up to the Homeland. Up to this date I have flown ten and hit the big ones as well as some of those little ones. The missions are tiring, they are about fifteen hours (and every minute of that is solid navigation time, believe me!) and this island does not one much to be elated over, either. Our groups are set up in the jungle, and take my word for it, we have very little of the Proverbial Air Corps comforts! But things could be worse, our raids are going very well- as you probably read-; we'll put up with anything as long as they keep going this well.

One of the more interesting aspects of this life on the Guam is the native people. They are amazingly American, very intelligent and well-mannered on the whole, and far more proud of their role under the American flag than a large number of the stateside population. But, then again, the war to them has been a horrible few years, and they are still trying to rebuild their lives anew. 

So much for that- I've missed the newspaper from the college- Miss Thompson, don't pass me up next issue or I'll be so far behind current events out there. You'll have to give me an orientation around when I return!

Incidentally, I've been hearing from Joe O'Sullivan, who is unhappy in Midland, Texas and Bob Pierson who is far more unhappy in India- Guam makes me feel like an honorary member in that classification.

But things aren't really so bad, -give my best to all.

As ever,

Arthur
