Dear Miss Thompson:

Yes I should have written you long ago. I've really sorry but I'll try to do better from now on.

Things are just about the same nothing new to report only that it is just about 100 F in the shade and has ----.

Please give my best regards to Miss Kain and everybody else at Newark State.

My only hope is that this darn war will soon be over and we can get back to our normal lives.

I am still teaching here at Corry Field but I might receive my orders any day as I have been here just about a year.

With luck I should make Senior Grade Lt. on July 1[st]. I have my fingers crossed as it would mean a nice boost in pay and that would help.

Also with luck I should get my next leave in September if I do. I'll bring Marion and Carol Ann around to pay you a visit.

Thank you for sending the College News it really helps one keep up with old friends. It is very interesting. I also get the Newark News and that keeps me posted on the local news.

I see Mr. Hess stepped up to a nice position. 

I'll have to sign off now as I have a flight coming in for a class.

Best regards as ever,

Wally
