Dear Mr. Hutchinson-

	I hope very much that this letter reaches you, if you are still at the college.

	Times have changed so much that me wonders where they'll be next in war. Will it be India, Guadalcanal, North Africa or some other geographical destination? I'm now attached as a radio mechanic to this [illegible] working on P. 34 fighters [illegible = ships? Not sure]. My life in this air corp has been as enjoyable and worries me. S' war I left college, I have learn `n how little I know and how much I have yet to learn. My travels are helping to bridge the gap to a small extent. 
	
	I realize that you too must be extremely busy in times like this. I don't look forward to a response from you for that reason. However, I do want you to know that you and the fellows that I call my fraternity brothers are still highly fresh in mind wherever I go.

	My best wishes to you and your family for good health and much prosperity. My wishes of course are "complete and unconditional surrender on the part of the Axis and peace."

					Fraternally
