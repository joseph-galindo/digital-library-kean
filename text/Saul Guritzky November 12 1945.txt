Die Deutsche Arbeitsfront

Dear Miss Thompson,

Since the end of the war, I was kept fairly busy with movements of various sorts, thus I was unable to write. At present I am at the Tempelhoff Airfield in Berlin, Germany. I was transferred to the 8[th] Airforce to the 301[st] Troop Carrier Sqdn. Being with this outfit gives me a wonderful chance to visit different places on the continent. 

Regardless of what important German city you think of the story is always the same  -  destroyed! In Berlin they have women cleaning up the streets and graves are spread through the city. It seems that the Germans did their best to bury their dead in order to prevent disease.

The German people seem to be very nice to us  -  but I sometimes wonder if they are not just waiting for us to leave. The Russians are real "characters" and almost every one of them carries some kind of gun.

Spend nine enjoyable days in London a short while back  -  really saw what made the place tick. London has improved greatly since the war ended. They are removing the roadblocks and emergency water supplies. Big Ben had his face washed and it really makes a difference.

No doubt male enrollment has increased greatly this semester as more men are released from Service. When I get home I'll drop down to good old Newark State, to really see some grand scenery. 

Regards to all the faculty.

P.S. How do you like the stationary.
