Dear Sir:

You will be gratified to know that a former student, Frederick W. Christoffel of 292 Belmont Ave., Newark, N.J. Class of '39, was commissioned today a second lieutenant in the Army of the United States at the graduation exercises of the Adjutant General's Officer Candidate School, Fort Washington, Maryland.

Lieutenant Christoffel won his promotion by his diligent efforts. His excellent record during service in the field gained him the opportunity to attend the Adjutant General's School. His application and hard work as a student during the twelve weeks course earned the approval of his instructors who have certified him to be officer caliber.

May I request that this notice be forwarded to the editor of your alumni publications for whatever use he may desire to make of it?

Sincerely,

AUBREY L. THOMAS,
CAPTAINM A.G.D.,
Public Relations Officer
