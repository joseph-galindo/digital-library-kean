Dear Mrs. Plenty,

Your New Years Ever letter chased me around the country & finally was delivered here a day or so ago. It was good to hear from you & about George. He certainly has traveled.

Since my last visit to the college I too have traveled. In two & a half months we have trained at Norfolk and Williamsburg, Va., Gulfport, Miss. and now we are at this point about 60 miles up the coast from Los Angeles. However, tomorrow morning we shove off again, this time probably for Seattle.

As near as we can tell it looks as though we are heading for Alaska or some other arctic region because we have the cloths, a sheepskin coat, parka, face mask, heavy sox, long-handled underwear, sweaters & headgear knitted by the Red Cross in Oklahoma city, artics, etc. All of this of course does not disclose our destination but it does give us something to talk about. Incidentally, since we are having a cold snap here, some of our arctic equipment has already been worn!

I often wonder if any of the other fellows from college are "Seabees". If any are interested you tell them that it is a good enough outfit especially if they like travel. It's the only branch of the services that definitely sign up for overseas service. We like well most of the time, especially when traveling on [illegible]. Coming out of here was really a pleasure trip.

As I have hinted before, we are all set for a boat ride somewhere, so I'll say good-bye for a while.

Regards to all at the college.

Sincerely

Hugh.
