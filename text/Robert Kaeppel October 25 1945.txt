Dear Miss Thompson,

	It has quite some time now since I received your very interesting letter of 2 Aug '45.  I'm sorry I haven't answered it sooner but I suppose you know how correspondence is pushed aside from day to day.  That is what has happened with me.  I just pushed it aside + did something else that seemed more important.  Please excuse the delay in answering.  
	Have you heard from Roy Daniels lately?  I heard at from him about a month ago.  He seems to be enjoying himself.  He has been on a vacation-furlough.  The gov't took him for a two week sightseeing trip thru Austria, Belgium + France.  He also spent some time at the Riveira.  
   To date the only thing I have done in that time is to have gotten a jeep and made a tour of this jewel in the Pacific
	The natives are interesting of course but one soon gets tired looking at them an the way they live.  Naturally I have made photographic record of all the wonderful sights.  Most of it is in color and I have to send the films to the states to be processed.  After processing it is sent to my home.  What it looks like I don't know.  The folks tell me that they look good but then they don't know too much about exposure etc.  
	Naturally the big question in everyones mind here is when are we going home.  The situation looks fairly good.  We only have one sixty pointer left.  Who will go next is the big question.  Things are moving quicker than I had expected they would.  
	Right now our photo work consists of flying + laying mosaics of Guam, Rota, Tinian + Siapan oh yes, Iwo too.
	We are managing to get in some of our personal work too.  There really would not be any sense in having a lab if we couldn't do our own work too.
	I believe that this brings you up to date on my activities on this romantic isle of Guam.
