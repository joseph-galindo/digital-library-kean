DEAR MISS THOMPSON,

PLEASE CONVEY MY SINCEREST SYMPATHIES TO MRS. FRENCH UPON THE PREMATURE DEPARTURE OF DR. JOHN FRENCH. HIS DEATH WAS A REAL SHOCK T OME, AND I'M POSITIVE THAT THE STUDENT BODY, ALUMNI, AND FACULTY MEMBERS WILL ALSO MISS HIS PROFOUND INFLUENCE IN AND OUT OF THE COLLEGE.

AS YOU CAN SEE FROM THE ABOVE HEADING, I'M STILL SOJOURNING IN ENGLAND. AT THE PRESTENT, I'M AWAITING THE TRIP BACK TO THE STATES, BUT DOUBT VERY MUCH WHETHER I'LL BE HOME SOON. I'VE STILL GOT MY HOPE UP HIGH, THO. EVERYTHING HERE IS FINE, AND I HAVE BEEN TAKING ADVANTAGE OF QUITE A FEW EDUCATIONAL TOURS THROUGH ENGLAND. SURE WILL BE IN TRIM FOR REAL LECTURING ON ENGLISH LIFE:

I WOULD APPRECIATE IT, IF YOU WOULD NOTIFY THE CIRCULATORS OF THE SERVICEMENS BULLETIN, OF MY CORRECT ADDRESS. THEY HAVE BEEN SENDING COPIES TO ME THROUGH THE WRONG A.P.O. THANK YOU.

THE WIFE AND I SEND OUR SINCEREST REGARDS TO YOU AND THE FACULTY FOR GOOD HEALTH, HAPPINESS, AND A SWELL SUMMER VACATION.

YOURS SINCERELY,

GEORGE AND RITA KLIMAN
