Dear Mr. Sloan:

Here I am back in North Africa in an Army hospital. I wasn't wounded but my feet and legs got into a worn out condition so I was sent here rest and treatment. When I'm ready again its back to duty for me again.

I certainly saw a good part of Italy while I was there. We spent a long time walking up and down the mountains chasing Jerry. Sometime we caught him and gave him a piece of our lead but other times he just ran when we came anywhere near. Outside of that routine I didn't do much more in the time I was at the front. Of course some of the meetings with the paper hanger's buddies were really worth description but I guess that will have to wait till the end of the war.

Here at the hospital we had a really swell Christmas thanks to the Red Cross. They have provided us with a radio which brings no end of excellent programs by top stars on records. Xmas Eve they had a party for us and believe me those girls of the Red Cross worked. Xmas morning each fellow had a package on his bed from the Red Cross. It was Xmas wrapped and in his own name. All in all thanks to Red Cross this war is being made much more pleasant than it might have been.

Nothing more to say so regards to the folks at school and what happened to that service paper of last year. Did they stop making them?

George
