Dear [illegible; Annahel Ler?],
	Thanks for the nice compliments, but remember if they are [iilegible; desewed?], I owe a great deal to you and the others. Whether you realize it or not, the guidance afforded me by th Library Staff was [illegible; bent?] all that I had for a long period of time.
	I hope that I will be able to see you the wake of December 14, 1942 when my [illegible; Feblengh?] begins prior to my enrollment at Fort Washington.

From present appearance, I think they will do just that.
	After twenty-one months at one place, one usually becomes attached. This is particularly [illegible; time?] in my case. It is not without regret that I make [illegible; naely] to leave my friends and my work. I believe that I am [illegible; alent?] th embark on frequent and long [illegible; trowels?]. This is not without pleasant anticipation. What I dread are the waits in between which by precedent are [illegible; memerone?]
	We are expecting Dr. Doll [illegible; here?] on th ninth and tenth of this month. He is new expert Consultant to th [illegible; Seeutay?] of Wa. To with packing and arranging [illegible; ferial detail?]. I have two busy weeks ahead of me.
As ever, 
Joe
