Hello Girls,

		Thanks for your card which is greatly appreciated. We had a swell Thanksgiving dinner at the school, which included everything from soup to mints and cigarettes!  But it was kinda disappointing because we still had to go to school that day. But we're not complaining as we think of our friends who are overseas- they don't get any days off!
	
	I just heard from Saul Bosek, who has just finished his primary flight training as an Air Cadet at Maxwell Field, Alabama. He told me to ask for the special newspaper that was printed at the College which contains the addresses of our boys in service. I would appreciate that very much if you could send it to me as well [slightly illegible due to tape].  I should like to contact some of my old classmates.
	Well, I am almost through the course here- expect to finish about Jan. 3. and then get shipped to an air base for further advanced training as an airplane mechanic.
 
We'll try to keep `em flying!
Regards to everybody.


						Sincerely,

					     "Mike" Lemerman
