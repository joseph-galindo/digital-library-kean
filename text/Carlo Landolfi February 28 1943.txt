   Dear Mr. Hutchinson:
	I suppose by this time you are thinking that I must be on the high seas already but do to good fortune am still having a swell time here in Fort Hamilton.  We don't know how long we'll be here or were we are going  -  as is usual in these cases.  
	We came here about three weeks ago and hope that we stay here at least three more.  This is a swell place.  We get all sort of entertainment sponsored by the Camp and U.S.O.movies, dances + Shows.
	However we try to maintain a normal schedule of work, so we have classes from 9 A.M. till 11 A.M. and from 1 P.M. to 4:30 These are mostly reviewing our coming duties that we were instructed in at Camp Ritchie.  In case we have good wheather we spend some time outdoors either playing baseball or hiking along the waterfront.
	It doesn't seem like the army!  I get home very often.  I expected to be home today but we were restricted last Wed. and don't know when it will be called off.  
	I received a nice letter from Miss Thompson which I appreciated greatly.  How's everything at school?  How many of my classmates are still there?  I guess not many.
	Don't worry, we'll all be back very soon, I'll see to that!
	Best regards to all and here's hoping I'll get another chance to visit Newark State again before we leave.  
Sincerely 
Carlo
