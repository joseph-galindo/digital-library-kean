U.S. ARMY AIR FORCES
3-8-44

Dear Faculty,

The last time I wrote to the college I was stationed at Selman Field, Louisiana. It was at this field that I received my first sample of navigation, and I might add the Army schools "throw" the information at you. It took plenty of hard work to make the grade  -  in addition we had night classes and military discipline. 

It seems in the Army the order to become an aerial officer you must do a multiple of jobs. I started to be an navigator, in addition to navigation we studied radio ground forces techniques, first aid and many other military subjects. At the present I am attending an aerial gunnery school and upon its completion will return to an advanced navigator's school.

Well, that brings the news up to the present time, and in closing I wish to thank the faculty and students for the wonderful newspapers they have been sending me; - it is needless to say how much I enjoy reading about Newark State and many of my fellow school mates.

Sincerely,

Saul Guritzky (Class 1940)

P.S. In my neat letter I hope to be able to relate the thrill one gets flying a B-24.
