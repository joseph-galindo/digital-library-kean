Dear Nancy:
	I hope that you've been able to stay out of mischief all these years that some of your old friends have been away. I've been stationed in France in an Engineer [Word crossed out and illegible] outfit keeping busy as a Beaver. I had hoped that I was on your list for N.J. S.T.C. releases but I guess I'm in the doghouse.
Nevertheless, even if I can't get on your preferred list, it would be appreciated if I could recieve the routine material.
                                                                      As ever,
                                                                          Leon
