Dear Miss Thompson,

I finally got around to writing to you. This Army life sure keeps me busy.

I received the first issue of "The Service Men's News" some time ago and enjoyed reading it a lot.

I was so surprised when I received that photo packet with the various snapshots taken in and about N.S.T.C. It was really swell of State Teachers to remember me like that. I don't know who to thank so I'll let you do that. Please convey my appreciation to everybody who was responsible for it.

Everything is under control here. The day after Christmas I was promoted from Corporal to Staff Sergeant so it made a very nice present.

At present I'm in charge of the Plans and Training (S-3) Section at Headquarters here. We're in charge of the training of the men; showing of films; and everything that has to do with training. We also see that every man fires the various weapons before leaving here. A few of the weapons include: the 37mm anti-tank gun; 81mm mortar; heavy machine gun; and etc.

Although there's a lot of work involved in my department I find it very enjoyable. Besides the Plans and Training work, I do all the drafting and drawing of all the charts. But one of the most interesting of my jobs is the handling of the learning films especially the new ones we have in technicolor. I have eight men just operating the motion picture machines at present.

I hope to be home next month and visit N.S.T.C. I've already got my reservations on the Streamliner to Newark and if everything goes as planned it won't be long when I see good old Newark.

Well, Miss Thompson, I think I've told enough for now. Again, thanks for everything.

As Ever,

Eddie Ezekian
Staff Sergeant, U.S. Army
