Dear Friends,

Recently I was home on furlough and of course visited the college, however, the library was closed. If I remember correctly it was the day of the entrance exams.

I moved again, and I am now at an Advanced Navigation School in San Marcos, Texas. We have long hours of classwork, but to compensate for the effort we have the interesting work of aerial navigation.

I had a chance to visit the University of Texas and the state capital, Austin. I have also seen a great deal of Texas from the air, and believe me I still prefer New Jersey.

I received several issues of the "Servicemens News" and I appreciate them more and more. It helps remember old times and old friends and the swell times had at Newark State.

Sincerely,

Saul Guritzky
