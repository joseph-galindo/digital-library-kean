Dear Miss Thompson,

I'm very sorry that I haven't been able to write you before, but I was, and I still am, up to my neck in work. The schedual here is really tough and for the first time in a lng time I am doing homework. The subjects that they gave me have everything  -  that I don't lie. Math, chemistry, ect. The subjects that I do like (History, psycology mechanical drawing) are taught terribly. I might pass however. The physical training here is really something, although it is simple compared with what I'm going to get at Paris Island. I thank Mr. Dan in my prayers every night for his `Previews of Torture', they really helped. I've gotten so that I do'nt feel the excercises anymore. I'm unconscious most of the time. You can understand that I have very little time to do much writing  -  notice it's the time I lack, in some stuff. In case you are interested, here is our daily schedual; 5;30 awake  -  6;00 exercises  -  7;25 chow  -  1;25 classes again (including more muscle mauling) 4;25 classes end  -  5;25 chow 7;00 yill 9;00 we are confined to quarters for study.  -  10;00 lights out.

You can see it's a pretty full day. I wish I had more time to write to the rest of the faculty, but I figured that you could tell them what's what if they are interested. In case there is anything you might want me to know, my address is:

Pvt. A. Bashover, U.S.M.C.
M.D. N.T.U., Co. A Billet #5
University of Rochester
Rochester, 3, New York

Please write if you can, and pardon these errors in spelling  -  you can see that I haven't changed much.

Pvt. Albert Bashover
