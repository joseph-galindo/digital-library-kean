May 7, 1943
Dear Miss Thompson,
I can understand your reluctance to accept all that comes to you hearsay about the boys in service. Having been with Stan at several of the bases to which he was attached, I have been subjected to the same rumors.
Your file and research in regard to the boys service records is a worthy task  -  after all this is over, many of the boys would probably like to have a look through it.
In regard to Stan's service record:
He was inducted at Newark, July 25, 1942  -  sent to Fort Dix from there  -  thence to Miami Beach, Florida Reception Center for reclassification  -  onto the Army Air Base at Amarillo, Texas to the technical school  -  he was graduated from that school with honors  -  sent to Seattle, Washington, to the Boeing factory for specialized training  -  on to Salt Lake City  -  another reception center  -  sent to the Air Base at Sioux City, Iowa  -  attached to the Base Headquarters  -  and yet another move took him to Grand Island, Nebraska Air Base with the rating of sergeant  -  attached to special services  -  then with true Army rapidity came his orders to report to the Ordinance Officer Candidate School at Aberdeen, Maryland  -  thus you have his Army career  -  varied and well-traveled  -  though probably not more so than many others.
The few copies of the "Servicemen's News" that reached Stan were so appreciated  -  some forwarded from base to base `til they reached him. When I was with him we both pored over them  -  as any news from home it was always welcome. You are to be complimented on the very excellent work you are doing with this paper.
I shall endeavor to send you a picture of Stan in the near future  -  the ones I have are not too clear.
Sincerely,
Myra O. Buchner
