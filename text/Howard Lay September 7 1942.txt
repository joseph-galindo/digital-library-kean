Dear Miss Thompson;

	Thank you so much for the information concerning the War Dept. correspondence courses.  I have already written them for a copy of their courses and list of colleges.  From what you have said one of those courses seem to be the best.  At present though I'm quite busy with school and won't have much free time until about the 1[st] of October.  These things take time so I might as well get all the applications and other necessary blanks lined up.  
	At present I'm in the hanger now as a student instructor with a regular class of Air Mechanic's.  We students instructors do quite a bit of the teaching and handling of the class.  In my spare time I'm busy trying to complete my notes and arrange my notebook.  So far so good I enjoy teaching.  How I'll feel about it after a year or so I don't really know.
I received a letter from George Metzler the other day.  He says the school is like a ghost and wishes the fall semester to hurry up and arrive.  Also he mentioned that most of the Sophomore Ind. Arts of last year would be back having successfully gotten in one of the Reserve Programs.  Which is perfect I believe.
	This Labor Day week-end has been a quiet one for me.  I went down to the University town of Champaign and Urbana over Saturday and Sunday.  The University of Illinios is huge and majestic.  I wouldn't mind attending that school..... and what pretty girls!! Ah, well, maybe someday!!?
	If I don't happen to receive my much delayed furlough in the next couple of months and be down to see N.J.S.T.C. something is radically wrong with the army or I'm being robbed.  
	Well, Miss Thompson have a enjoyable time during the rest of your vacation and thank you again.
						As Ever
