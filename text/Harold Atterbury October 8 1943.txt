Dear Miss Thompson:

Thank you for your very nice letter & the mimeographed list of my classmates.

Sands that looked as tho they would quickly run out have de-veloped a high degree of molecular attraction  -  in fact they are veritably clinging to the hour glass.

As far as one can determine, temporarily the Medics have reached a point of saturation  -  officers, non coms, and privates. The MRTR at Camp Picket has been closed and a large part of the personnel have been stationed in casual battalions here at Berkeley. From here they will be slowly absorbed when & where they are needed.

All of our boys here have done a good job in basic  -  Clausen, Rudurtzshi(sp?), Ferraro, & Trup(sp?). I think all of them made ASTP (I was way over the age limit) all of them are still here although a part of the ASTP candidates have been shipped.

We have now been out of basic 3 full weeks and after a week of rock picking & grass pulling we are now sharing "warmed over hash" with the uprooted cadre from Picket  -  ie. classes & hikes, marches, etc. It's a bit trying, but we'll survive.

Thanks for writing.

Respectfully yours.

Harold.
