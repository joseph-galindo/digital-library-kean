Dear Miss Nancy T,
	at last I have a permanent address. I [illegible; uported?] to Fort Washington to [illegible; diseaies?] that the men selected for th [illegible; Personnel [?] consultants' cause were to be [illegible; adued?] out to different stations for an internship period of two months or so after which we would be [illegible; adued?] back to th Student [illegible; Offecies?] School at Fort Washington.

I went to atlanta and was I happy because it was just th [illegible; davdiest?] place I've been -- I [illegible; usited?] th cyclorama and met, of all people, Seatt, you might till Miss Brown that if she will [illegible; stave or stare?] still long enough to listen. 
	Imagine my disappointment when I learned that I was at Hq 4th [illegible; Seurie?] Command [illegible; just?] awaiting [illegible; uassignment?] to one of its commands. Then, imagine my [illegible; [illegible; consternation?] when I learned it was Fort McClellan, a lake in the hills. Will, I was due for a [illegible; supusi?] -- because I was assigned to Headquarters, as part of th Station Complement with [illegible; privileges?] of a Staff [illegible; Offecie?].  She's part of th Camp is a county club. White [illegible; Stueu?] [illegible; buildings?],  [illegible] til [illegible; roofs], in Spanish style; golf course, tennis Court, swimming pool. [illegible; Suank?] [illegible; Offieus?] club. Hod [illegible;drenis?] with Allan Jones last week -- I have a room for myself and an [illegible; nelrly?] to clean it.  God: it's wonderful.
	I am called a Pre-Induction Classification [illegible; Officer?] assigned to th Armed Forces  Recruiting and Induction Station. My duties are those of a psychological examine. We work with th navy and th [illegible; Maunies?].My senior [illegible; Officer?] was chief Psychologists for th new york School System [illegible; befae?] he enlisted in th new [illegible; difuent?] Army Specialists Corps.
