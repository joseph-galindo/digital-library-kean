AMERICAN RED CROSS

Nov. 27, 1943

Dear Miss Thompson  - 

Believe it or not I have been going to school again. Graduated yesterday with diploma and all and now fully qualified as an instructor of camowflage! Do you think the Jersey school system would be interested in an A-1 camowflage teacher? That calls for a conference with Mr. Hatch, doesn't it? Now that school is over I am enjoying a few days of relaxation in Oran before I head back to rejoin my outfit. Incidentally I am in the Red Cross Officers recreation building. It's the first time I ever saw some recreation provided for officers by the Red Cross. They usually are concerned with the enlisted men only. I have just had a pint of real honest-to-goodness ice-cream. And if you think that wasn't a treat after doing some ten months of doing without you're badly mistaken.

Tomorrow I expect to head up to my outfit & probably will be in Algiers on Monday. If so I shall try writing again and give you my impression of the largest city in Africa.

If you see Mr. Richmond give him h___ & tell him he owes me a letter. Thanks  - 

Ted
