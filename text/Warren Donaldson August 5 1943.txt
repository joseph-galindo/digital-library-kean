U.S. COAST GUARD

Thursday Aug 5[th]

Dear Miss Thompson,

By this time I am sure you have lost track of me because I haven't been receiving the Servicemens Publication that our college has been issuing. Since my New London, Conn. address I've had one in Charleston, NC, Baltimore, MD, Norfolk, VA, Seneca, ILL, New Orleans, LA, Panama City, Fla, Guantanimo, Cuba, and now it's the Fleet P.O. San Francisco, Cal. I'm really on my way now, doing duty onboard an L.S.T. (amphibious force). So far I've enjoyed every minute of this great experience and I've seen places I never would have seen had I not joined this service. 

Please extend my regards to the faculty and the few remaining students that I am familiar with. It seems hardly possible that I've been out of college over a year.

I remain,

Warren Donaldson, Ens. USCGR
