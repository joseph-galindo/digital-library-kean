AMERICAN RED CROSS

Kanazawa, Japan
14 January 1946

Dear Miss Thompson,

With all the Chinaware in this section of Japan, I couldn't resist sending a little something representative of this section.

These are called Kutani (sp?) ware., a distinct type of pottery made particularly here in Kawazawa. Hope you find some use for them!

Regards,

George
