CAMP LEE
VIRGINIA

Sunday
August 16, 1942

Dear Mr. Hutchinson,

After spending a hectic week at the receptions center of Fort Dix, I was shipped out to Camp Lee, Virginia. Camp Lee is a Quartermaster training center and is situated on some of the most historic battle grounds of the Civil War, in Petersburg, just twenty three miles out of Richmond.

I'm at present receiving my basic military training and have only two weeks remaining. I am also going to school four nights a week, attending classes on administration and supply division of the Quartermaster Corps.

Mr. Hutchinson, in about a week, I will be given the opportunity to apply for officers training. Therefore, I would very much like to have on hand a letter of recommendation from Dr. Shaffer. I shall appreciate it a great deal if you will make it possible for me to obtain this letter in the near future. 

The name of my commanding officer is Captain Oscar G. Piland.

My sincere regards to Dr. Shaffer and the faculty!

Very cordially yours,

Thomas Calcerano Jr.
