Dear Miss Thompson  - 

Wish the deuce my lap and knees would stay put so I could get this letter off to you.  -  Do you have any trouble decoding some of the incoming mail? Has Kezer's hand improved any?

Have your July 17[th] letter before me and have read it twice; so you see I do enjoy mail from N.S.T.C. a great deal.

The soldiers' bulletin arrived a week or so ago and I just ate up every printed word.  -  Keep up your fine work.

I am limited to the amount of information I can give concerning my activities, however, I may say that it covers a phase of military intelligence..

Concerning the war news. You people know just as much as we do. Everyone is putting his shoulder to the wheel so as to bring this war to a sooner termination.

The heat is still with us, around 115 [degree symbol] but it doesn't compare with other spots where the temp hit 140 [degree symbol]. Therefore, I think we're quite lucky.

While reading the bulletin I noticed a good many of the boys have earned commissions. It must be true what they say about N.S.T.C.  -  We old-timers owe it all to Dr. Townsend. 

Is Mr. Z. and Mr. Hutchinson still with us. The Dans.? Mr. Sloan?  -  Wish Andy is still on the staff upon our return so we can all give him an intensive quiz on world geography. Just a retribution!!!

Are teachers in demand back home? Wonder what it will be like when the boys come marching back to look for jobs?  -  Have a hunch many are going to stay in the service.

Regards to everyone

Rom Pannullo
Lt. Inf.
