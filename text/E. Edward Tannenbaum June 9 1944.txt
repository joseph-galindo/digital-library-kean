Dear Miss Thompson: - Today 6-9-44, I received the April Service Men's News. It our course came but late due to the fact that you don't have my address. In the upper right hand corner is the correct one. Please use it often and lets hear all the news about the school.

I'm now located high on a plateau surrounded by mountains. Its really a beautiful site where our hospital is located. However, the Japs know where we [illegible] and let us know it. When I was with the Engineers, we had plenty of action. In fact, one hour after we arrived, lest you sometime, before we got off the boat, we were bombed and many were injured. Here at this hosp., I see many casualties and get a chance to talk with our boys. Each has a different tale to tell. The only thing I don't like here is New Guinea  -  its too hot, rainy and stuffy. The rain really beats down.

I've been a Captain a long time now. When your letter came, it was addressed "Lieutenant" and the boys really gave me a "raggin."

How are Mr. & Mrs. D'Angola, Miss Cain, Dr. Schaeffer, Miss Thompson, Lipson, Mrs [illegible] (Miss Lee), Miss Rice, and all of the faculty? Oh yes, Mr. Sloan

Thanks for your newspaper. Here come some planes, the signals off again & now I'll search for my foxhole.

Wasn't bad  -  some scare, that all. They missed their mark again.

Hope to see you all. We say  -  "Golden Gate in '48."

It sure can't come fast enough for me. 

Sincerely

E. Edward Tannenbaum
Captain
