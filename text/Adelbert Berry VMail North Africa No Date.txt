Dear Miss Thompson,

Salutations from North Africa.

After many days and many many miles I find myself resting for the moment in Africa. 

I visited Casablanca, and it was a fine treat to see the many things of interest, and the natives are friendly.

I would like to know where the other members of the class of "46" are, girls included. I am very anxious to get back to the many friends I had made, and the pleasant scenes about our school.

My job will take quite some time to complete, but until it is finished I will not rest. The many things I left behind I miss very much, and I would be grateful for any bit of news you can send me. 

Give me love to Mrs. Plenty, Mr. Hutchinson, and the other members of the faculty who were my guides and teachers.

My prayers for peace and the safety of my friends, and for a deeper faith in God. I will write again soon. (New A.P.O. -> 600 C/O Postmaster NY, NY).

Yours in Christ,

Adelbert Berry
