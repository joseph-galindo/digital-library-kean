Dear Mr. Hutchinson  -  

You're quite correct  -  K.C. is a pretty hot town, from any angle, heat or otherwise.

Well I'm not overseas yet but it might not be so far in the future since I graduate from M.A.I. August 22[nd] and my next destination is in the very nebulous state.

Expect to receive a pair of silver wings, a diploma and leave for an air base somewhere. Where? Well your guess is as good as mine. With school behind me, I'll be the boy who determines whether or not the plane is going to fly.  -  and if it does I may be the flight engineer who really flies the plane  -  and not the pilot as so many folks think  -  no matter how problematic  -  a future does lie before me  -  

If I hit the "right" spot, I'm due for a furlough, sergeant's stripes and a possible officer's candidate status  -  

If it's the "wrong" base, most likely I'll be doing K.P. or guard duty for a good month before I even see a plane.

K.C. is still a wonderful town but after almost (1/2) year of it  -  it should not be too hard to leave it dispite its obvious attractions.

I'll write you from my next base when I get there  -  

Fraternally  -  

Gil
