19 Dec 1943

Dear Miss Thompson,

The Christmas card is marvelous, I really got a thrill from the montoge and map pictures. All of which reminds me  -  did you send the picture to the "Fortone" cartographer? We promised him one, remember.

I started taking my classification tests today, they are really comprehensive  -  and I do mean comprehensive. They ask everything! I think I did allright, except, as usual, in math. The only thing that really has me worried is the physical  -  I may not be able to pass due to the pneumonia I had last summer.

Enough personal history  -  this "city" of Nashville is really terrific  -  the dirtiest and cheapest place I hope ever to see. Even the chaplains warned us about it in a detailed accord. There are thousands of soldiers on maneuvers around here and Nashville is really a "camp town" in all its derogrative meaning.

Who is this new instructor? What is he like? I hope he is good, there is so much dead wood lying around "teaching" these days  -  there ought to be a law against it. I never felt this way before, but since I've been in the army I realize how cruel it is to have such people teaching. We had quite a few of them at Mass State and it is so apparent how miserably they failed in their duties to us. (Maybe you had better not publish this letter).

Sincerely

Bill Harrell
