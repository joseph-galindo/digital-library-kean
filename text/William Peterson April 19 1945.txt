Dear Mr. Sloan,
	Just a line [Illegible] to let you know that your Christmas greeting arrived and is very much appreciated. It is the first expression I have heard from anyone along that line of appreciation-and might I add-the first I have heard from Newark Stat in all the time I have been in the army. Thanks again-and now I know what Reggie [Illegible] meant when she said you were the greatest moral builder and "we should have first sergeants like him."


	We've been rather busy over here doing this and that and the other thing and now it looks as if it will be over soon- (we all hope). Am looking forward to "Mr. Sloan's class, fourth period." Thanks again  -  be seeing you [Illegible] soon.
                                                                  Best wishes,
                                                                 Bill Peterson
