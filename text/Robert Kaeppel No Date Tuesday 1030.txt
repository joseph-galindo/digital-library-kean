								Tues 1030
Hi Miss Thompson,

	While I have a few minutes I though I should write a few times to you and let you know what is going here at Will Rogers Fld.  As you know John G + Paul Sauls were both here.  I saw both of them but since they left I haven't heard a word from them.
	I am now working in our Sqd. Photo Lab which is a lot more enjoyable than working in an orderly room of a Sqd. as I was doing for about three months.  Our work here is purely Recon.  We do very little ground photography.  Practically the only ground work we do is our own personnel.  
	In the very near future I expect another change of address.  When I get it I will relay the info to you.
	Miss Thompson that's about all for now.

						Sincerely
						Robert Keappel
