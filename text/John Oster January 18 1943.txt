Dear Miss Thompson

Just to drop a line or so. To let you know I'm back up "North"  -  for a change. 

Thanks for your seasons greetings.

I greatly appreciated receiving the Alma Mater publications.

Well up here, sort of going "back to school" for a change.

There aint much I can write about.

Best of wishes & luck

Regard to all

Sincerely

As Ever

John Oster
LT. ORD. DEPT.
