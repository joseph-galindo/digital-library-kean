Dear Miss Thompson,
	This is probably the wrong time to write because of the summer vacation at old Newark State, but I just received an edition of the "Service Men's News" yesterday and can't help feeling that I must drop you a line.    As you already know, I'm over here somewhere in England and rather enjoying things so far.  You mentioned me twice in this edition of the News so I am happy to see that I haven't been forgotten at the old school.  I want to thank everyone for the edition of the annual.  It will certainly seem different around the school without my old class.  I know there are several of the boys over here in England, but not knowing their addresses, I can't get in touch with them.
	As you have probably guessed, I am shooting pictures right and left and now have quite a collection.  Someday I hope to enlarge to some of my best and exhibit them back at Newark.
	So Bob Kaeppel has been wondering where I went to, well I dropped him a line yesterday.  I hope he is still there in Oklahoma.  I wrote Johnnie, thinking he was still there and would see Bob but I guess Johnnie has moved too because as yet I've received no answer from him.  
	There isn't a great deal that I can write about so I'll finish this off now.  Remember me to Mr. Richmond and all the rest of the gang and the girls in the cafeteria kitchen.

							As always,
								Paul
P.S. Yes, I've made corporal since coming over here.
