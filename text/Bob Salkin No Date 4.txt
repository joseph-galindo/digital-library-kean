Dear Miss Thompson

Roll out the welcome mat- Here come P.F.C. Lay and P.F.C. Salkin- 
	Our furloughs start April 1[st]- end April 15[th] . 
   It'll be swell to get home once more- to freeze with the rest of you- to see Times square- Broad and Market Street- The unkept streets of Bayonne.  Honestly, I can't wait
						Bye 
						Bob
