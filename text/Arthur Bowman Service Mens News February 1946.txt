Arthur Bowman
The faculty and friends of Arthur Bowman, of the class of 1945, were deeply grieved at the news of his death in a plane crash off Guam, on October 3d, 1945. This latest fatality is especially heartrending, since we had every reason to expect Arthur home for the holidays and were looking forward to his return, with others of his class, to the college. He was an outstanding student and a favorite with us all, and his loss is especially hard to take. We will greatly miss his leadership and the sterling qualities that made him an inspiration to everyone around him.
