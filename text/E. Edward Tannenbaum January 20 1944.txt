Dear Miss Thompson:

I hope this letter finds you in the best of health. Likewise for Miss Lipson and Miss Lee & Rice. Greeting to the Library Club from New Guinea. I've been for a while in Australia [Censored] war news, we make it. [Censored] know why. The Engineers do wonderful work. I [illegible] in a battalion aid station doing all kinds of work. I hold sick call, evacuate to a hospital, defense council on a court-martial board, and Special Services officer & PX officer.

I organized athletic teams and [illegible] an outdoor movie. I had hundreds & hundreds on the mountainside for a show last evening. The pictures are old but anything is perfect & new to us. Haven't heard a Radio in months. 

All delicacies here are missing. My mouth waters when I think of good american candy, apples, juicy pears etc.

Its hot & very muddy. Rains very often, comes down by the bucketful. The natives are short, black, bushy hear, wear only a loin cloth, no shoes, stockings nor a thing else. Women natives are just as nude. This is real jungle with its animals, insects, snakes & japs. If & when I come back, I'll have plenty of stories to tell. Remember me to Dr. Schaeffer & the whole faculty & Mrs. Vaughn-Eames, Mrs. & Mr. French & the others.

Lets hear from you,

E. Edward Tannenbaum
