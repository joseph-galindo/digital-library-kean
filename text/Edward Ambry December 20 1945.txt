Dear Miss Thompson,

	Just a short note to let you know of my where-abouts. I am about to be discharged from the Service and will become a civilian on the 2[nd]. of Jan. 1946. On that afternoon I will start on my new job. I had intended to re-enter the teaching field but like a lot of other men coming out of the service the salaries being offered in this field caused me to take a fast `look-around' to see what I could pick up in some other field. I ran into an excellent position as Field Executive for the Boy Scouts of America and signed a contract to go to work for them on the above date.

	My address will be Bronx Valley Council, Boy Scouts of America Inc., 12 East First Street, Mt. Vernon, New York.

	My home address will be, for at least a few months, 4 Maple Drive, Great Neck, Long Island, New York (Penthouse Apartment).

	If Newark State Teachers wants to contact me for any reason the above address could be used or the old stand-by in Jersey City would probably do just as well...262 Duncan Avenue, Jersey City, New Jersey.

	I want to take this time to thank you for the Service Men's News and for the very nice Xmas cards I have received during the past few years. I have a very warm spot in my heart for Newark State and you can feel sure that it is because of people like you that it has been kept warm during the years it was not easy for me to "drop in and see my friends".

	Thank you again and the best of everything to you and all other Newark Staters during the Holiday Season and for the New Year.

                                                                    Sincerely,
                                                                   [Signature]
                                                             Ensign E.J. Ambry
