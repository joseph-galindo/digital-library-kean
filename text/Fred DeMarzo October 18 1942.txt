SERVICE CLUB
SCOTT FIELD, ILL.

October 18, 1942

Dear Miss Baldwin,

The vagaries of fortune are many  -  strange and varied. Time certainly changes man's lot leading him onward through paths he never knew existed.

This I believe would be most applicable in my present situation.

I know I haven't written to you in a very long time  -  still I never forgot you and always meant to write to you.

For your information I have been a successful teacher and up until the Army drafted me I was leading a very happy life.

After I was drafted, I was assigned to the Air Force ground crew and sent to Miami Beach Fla. for a period of training. Then I was shifted to Scott Field.

Presently I am learning to be a radio operator mechanic and within a few short months I shall have been prepared to shoulder my burden in this titanic struggle.

Time is limited  -  my correspondence great. I shall write more later on.

Please remember me to my friends at good old N.S.T.C. Best regards to all.

As ever,

Fred DeMarzo
