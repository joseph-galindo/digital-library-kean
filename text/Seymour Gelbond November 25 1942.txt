UNITED STATES AIR FORCE

Nov. 25[th] `42

Since your letters are always most welcome I should appreciate a resumption of our correspondence  - 

Stewart Field is really glowing  -  should be quite an air base after the War  -  However what with overseas shipments constantly coming up and the growing possibility of OCS I doubt that I shall remain here until completion. 

Feeling very well  -  due no doubt the wholesomeness if not the delicacy of army chow  -  Despite the typical scowl (on the picture) army life does agree  -  I guess I'm turning to my college pacifism into a martial spirit  -  Not quite sure  -  Still building that philosophy. 

Had quite a scare the other day  -  Sent my plane into the air it rose quite majestically. However upon reaching the upper strata, it suddenly developed a minor coughing jag  -  "Ah!", thought I, "there goes my barnyard mechanix!" To be sure, I was quite relieved when my gal resumed her normal drone in fortissimo  -  Learned later that the carberator had iced up due to lack of use of the carburator air heating device installed in the cockpit  - 

So  -  undismayed and with new confidence in my technical skill I continue to grope thru the wonderland of cylinder heads, baffles, shock struts, rocker boxes, generators, magnetoes, engaging polenoids, primer lines, vacuum pumps  -  ad infinitum  - 

Still would appreciate a list of addresses  -  

Hope to see you soon  -  

Sincerely,

Seymour Gelbond
