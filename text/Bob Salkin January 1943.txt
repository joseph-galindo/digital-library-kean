								[Nancy Thompson:  Jan- `43]
Dear Miss Thompson----
	Many thanks for that Christmas card---- sorry I sent none, but there were none to be had---- they were grabbed up weeks ahead of time. 
	My work is extremely interesting----.  I'm teaching how to change engines from one plane to another, how to drive emergency hoists, fuel transfer from one "drum" to another and how to start a field energize motor unit.
	Yesterday I pre-flighted an old army attack plane.  It has a 800 horsepower engine.  Care had to be taken because the plane had no brakes and if we "served" it to more than 1200 R.P.M. it may have "jumped" the wheel chocks and given us a very surprising taxi ride.
	There is no thrill greater than that in starting an airplane engine.  When you push forward on the throttle and feel the throb and pulsations of the engine and of the prop you have the feeling of power and dormant force that's indescribable.
	I had hoped to get a furlough in time for alumni day but it's very improvable---- not enough instructors.  I'm not complaining though, the work is very interesting and my education is still continuing.  I'm thankful for the chance to teach.  
	Remember when I had promised you a regimental pin?  I haven't forgotten---- they're very hard to get, but I'll send one as soon as possible.  
						Sincerely
						Bob Salkin
