Letter  -  A/C William E. Harrell (1943)
16 September, 1944

It seems to me that the colleges would do well to adapt the Army style of teaching ex-soldiers  -  it is a system they understand and it would help them to adjust to civilian life. All the men I have met that intend to go in for further "thinking" after the war is over have a precise and definite idea of what they want and where they want to get it and a great many colleges will have to give it to them if they are state-supported. One idea I had there is a series of college credit courses designed to help the service man by telling him what has happened in the U.S.A. while he was away  -  economically, politically etc. Such an exchange of ideas between the G.I.s and the folks back home would do a great deal toward a mutual understanding. I'll be perfectly franl with you, I feel that the present curriculums will need re-vamping...to much waste and not enough meat. A good course in air relationships, air travel, air-mindedness in general, not just talk about it....This, then, is what I recommend the post-war college do (In outline)

  1. Adapt Army-methods for quick specific technical knowledge for ex-service men who know what they want
  2. Adopt a program of some sort to bridge the gap between G.I.s and soldiers
  3. Substitute a program of active air mindedness
  4. Substitute course in politics and government
  5. A balanced physical training program to help build and retain physical fitness.
  6. Much closer community relationships..be a part of the community, not an addition or after-thought.
Note: Harrell was an Industrial majorl he entered the services, May, 1943 and received his degree in absentia in June of the same year. He is completing his training for a commission in the Air Corps at Victorville, Cal.
