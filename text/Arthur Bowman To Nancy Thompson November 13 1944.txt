Dear Miss Thompson-

This is my new home for a while it seems  -  and its truly a ride away in every sense of the word  -  I might add, far from heavenly.

I'm in a B-29 unit, as you probably know, all crewed up and in our phase training. This time I really have my hands full speaking in the navigational sense. We're continuously polishing up our celestial accuracy plus the fine other methods that a 29 incorporates. Its all very interesting  -  which is about its only redeeming feature, because it means a lot of hard work and I mean that in its true sense!

Nevertheless, it is quite an experience you can well imagine.

So much for my sorrows, - It certainly was a nice experience to have been able to stop in at the school while I was home, - I presuppose that life back there is still moving along as always- a nice think to look forward to anyway! For now, though  -  I'll sign off with my best wishes to all. Certainly hope I'll be able to drop in on you one of these days-

Yours,

Art Bowman

P.S. No, I haven't become this shamefully brief in my old age  -  its just the time element, as usual -
