Portland Air Base, Oregon
January 31, 1943

Dear Miss Thompson,

I hope you'll forgive me for not writing to you as often as I should have. I'm glad to say that this is my permanent address, at least for quite a while. I'm assigned to the 44[th] Base Headquarters Squadron. My job is this; I stay out at the field and service all transient planes. This includes Army, Navy planes.

Sometimes if some of them have a little trouble and its our job to see that the trouble is ironed out. Besides that I'm assigned to a crew that consists of 4 men. We take care of a plane that is stationed at our field. It's called a C-78. This plane is used by the officers of my squadron for various reasons. One is just so they can get their flying time in, another is to get from one field to another. It is a 5 passenger ship. Twin engines and fabric covered. Well that's enough about me. Oh yes, this is the best camp that I've ever been in. The meals are really the tops. The officers are swell. I work every day except Tuesday which is my day off. I really enjoyed it, coming here, the work I mean. 

I'd like to say right now that I miss N.J.S.T.C. very much. I miss the familiar voices in the corridors, the smell of the shops, and of course the relaxations in the library. I miss very much the people I met during my stay at the college. I know I'll see them again. I feel that it will be real soon. Don't you?

I guess the school is just about empty, of men I mean. I hear that the ones that are there are in the reserves. I remember before I left school what Chief said, "If I don't have enough men for the basketball team, the girls will play." I think it won't be long before they will have to play.

Say Miss Thompson I wonder if you would like to have several snapshots of myself and of various camps I've been in. I can't get them right now because I'm not in my barracks but I will later. 

It's getting close to bed time so I'll have to stop now. Give my regard to Miss Lee.

Sincerely yours,

Al
