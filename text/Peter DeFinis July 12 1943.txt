My Dear Miss Thompson,

I'm surprised at myself for not having written to you sooner. I have been very busy however and this is the first time I've had some real time to write.

I have been assigned to the Coast Artillery and am at Camp McQuaide in California. We are always kept busy reading up material for classes. They are cramming a years work in a mere 13 weeks. We are given regular Infantry training, in addition we are given work on cannons and anti-aircraft guns.

I sure do miss school, yes and the library too. I will always remember how the entire staff there was always so willing to help me find my material. I miss the crowd of teachers and pupils. But until this mes ends, sooner I hope, I will just keep remembering, "My College Daze" and what it really means to all of us. 

Sincerely,

Peter DeFinis
