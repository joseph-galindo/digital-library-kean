Dear Miss Thompson,
	Hello, Miss Thompson I suppose you're surprised to hear from me.  Well, sometimes I manage to keep my promises about writing.  Seeing I have a new address, which I most Likely will have for quite awhile, I'm sending you it.
	I suppose you are getting ready for the "mad" rush of new freshman.  Will there be any fellows entering school?  On second thought, maybe that was a silly question.  I see where the group of girls I went to classes with are going to go out on practicum and start their senior year, boy-time sure does fly.
	Give my regards to any of the faculty that know me, especially Mr. Dan.  So long for awhile, I'll be looking for the "Reflector".  Over there
Sincerely,
Bill Menweg
