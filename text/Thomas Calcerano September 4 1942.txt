Dear Miss Thompson,

Thank you ever so much for your very nice letter of recommendation. 

As you probably know, the Army is very regimented and believe in being exact. Therefore, it will question the fact that your letter refers to Thomas Calcerano instead of my correct name, Thomas Calcerano Jr.

I hate to ask you, but I shall be very grateful if you will write another letter for me. 

Also Miss Thompson, I realize that you do not know me very well and do not have as much knowledge about my college activities as Miss Kain has.

So, it would be very nice if you include in your letter the following information, to show the officers who receive it my possibilities of becoming a leader.

At college, I was a member of the Horns(sp?) Theater Guild, member of the Social Committee, and a member of the fencing team. At the end of last year, I was elected chairman of the social committee and captain of the fencing team. 

I trust you know how this information should be woven into the letter.

I would like to have this letter on hand as soon as possible because I have already passed the Army I.Q. Examination and am due to appear before the first board.

Thank you again.

Sincerely,

Thomas Calcerano Jr.
