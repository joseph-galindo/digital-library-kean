Dear Miss Thompson,
	First of all please forgive for not getting in touch with you sooner.  I was not certain though until the past week as to where I would be stationed so I decided not to write until I was permanently settled.
	After leaving Fort Dix I spent eight weeks at Kessler Field, Miss. taking basic training.  I was then sent to Alabama Univ. to take tests and interviews.  After four weeks I left Alabama, and now I'm stationed here at Lafayette to take a course in electrical engineering.
	The set up here and the location is ideal.  We are situated on a small mountain which overlooks the Delaware River and New Jersey.  The campus is beautiful, and the athletic facilities are tops.
	I'm a P.F.C. now, but we are considered engineering cadets here; therefore everyone uses Cadet before their name instead of their rank.
	I hope you and the rest of the faculty are in good health.  Despite the good fortune I have, I sure would like to be back at good ole N.S.T.C. to mingle with the friends I made there.  I'm hoping to see all of you soon, with them I remain.
Sincerely,
Bill Menweg
