Hello Dr. Dougall,

I was very glad to receive your invitation to the N.S.T.C. Homecoming. I hope to be able to attend as I am expecting a furlough about that time.

My six months in the Army has been very interesting, although I rather miss N.S.T.C..

As you can see by my address I'm stationed at Yale. Studying Japanese of all things.

I hope to see you on the twelfth.

Sincerely,

Clarence F. Brasch
