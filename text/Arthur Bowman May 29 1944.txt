Dear Miss Thompson,

Many times during lull in the activity of a replacement co., here I wondered as to how much here I changed from the young man I was way back in 1936. I will only know when I again measure myself against the same background that I left. For one thing I have gotten a comprehension of the United States not from books or statistics from all types of men from all states of society. In my own tent one man is from Iowa, another is from Maine and the third from Tennessee. We all ridicule each other's native peculiarities but at the same time we are learning to understand the other's background. I hope that awareness is not lost by the rest of the Army after demobilization. We truly are a united states now. 

In my particular job I don't get out and around as much as I'd like to. So far I have visited most of the tourist traps in Italy but Caprit(sp?). That is off limits. I witnessed several of the tremendous columns of fire and debris belched up by Vesuvius recently. It was truly awe inspiring. There's not anyone so far in Africa or Italy from school. I correspond with Phil Goldberg and Walter Nelson(Wilson?). It was very nice to hear from you and if you are not too busy I'll have gossip some (illegible).
