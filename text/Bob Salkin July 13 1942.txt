My dear Miss Thompson;
	Thank you for the card, I appreciate it.  It's a pleasant feeling knowing that I'm still considered a member of the school, although an alumnus.  
	I'm still attending Airplane mechanics school, and will be graduated in 14 more school days.  "Howie" Lay is attending school here too, and will be graduated in 4 more days.  Even Nick Fine is here and has a swell job at testing "trade testing".  His wife is with him and they live off the post.  
	Tonight I was interviewed for officers Candidate school.  I feel that it went along without a "hitch".  My education is really a great factor in my favor. 
	I've spent the last four weekends in New Orleans- it's only 86 miles away.  The main street there resembles Broad St, Newark very much.  The town is clogged with soldiers and sailors of the United Nations- it's a thrill to salute a British Major. 
	I'm going to apply for an instructor's job in the schools here after graduation.  I've my heart set on teaching. 
	Recently our Barack Team won the Squadron Championship in softball, and lil' Bobby Salkin was the pitcher- nuf sed 
	I've lost 12 pounds due to the incemant heat, but I eat like a pig to make up for it. 
	Yes maim, we have variety in ford- five kinds of beans for some meals- Don't get me wrong, I'm not complaining, I really like this life.  If things work out all right I may even stick to it after the war.  
	Is there some provision made for sending "Reflections" to the students in service- if there is, please let me know. 
	Last year I helped set up the printing job for Mr. Hess' southern tour, but who would ever think I'd take it!
	Please give my regards to Miss Lipson and Mrs. Arveschoug.
						Sincerely 
						Bob Salkin
