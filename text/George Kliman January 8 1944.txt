Dear Miss Thompson,

I received your swell Christmas cards dated December 16 and was so happy. As you know, my wishes we extended to you and the faculty for a happy and enjoyable Christmas. However, I add my wishes in this letter that the coming New Year holds good news and victory for our side. This coming Monday, I am going on pass to a certain large city to meet Sid Krueger. My lieutenant has given me a few days off to travel and enjoy the sights. I hope to write a more interesting letter after my trip. Got swell Christmas cards too from Mr. Sloan and Miss Barber. Regards  - 

George
