In Flight
ON THE MAINLINER

Feb. 17[th], 1946

Hello Miss Thompson,

Just a note to let you know that I am almost all the way cross-country. Tell Mrs. Plenty for me that the changing time zones has (illegible) (illegible) confused. I almost had a fight with a fellow passenger because he said I had the wrong time, but I didn't I had E.S.T. But with the stewardess help we got all straightened out.

One of the most beautiful sights I have ever seen was this morning  -  Sunrise over the "Rockies".  -  But there have been many things to amaze me during this flight  -  the landings, the take offs, pretty stewardess, Chicago above with lights at night, Detroit at night, the wonderful meals served aboard the plane, the efficiency of "United" and many other things.

Flying gives you the feeling that you are an insecure little particle floating in space, and to look down and see cars, trucks, and trains looking like tiny insects is enough to change one's views immediately. I have had an amazing geographical view of our country and I wish every American could make this flight. Our country is so huge I never realized it before.

I am sending you a few postcards, hope you enjoy them!

Sincerely,

Clarence
