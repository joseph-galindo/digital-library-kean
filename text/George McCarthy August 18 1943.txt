	My Dear Miss Thompson,
	I've been meaning to write you and let you know just how I shape up to army life. While I was at Atlantic City I did not have the time, as basic training was nothing to sneeze at. I am now stationed at Norwich Un. Norwich is the second oldest Military Academy in the country. It was founded twelve years after West Point.
	The country up in these parts are is really beautiful. It is just the place for studying.  -  (very quiet.)
	Among the various subjects I have are; Math, Physics, Geography, and a few military subjects.
                                    - 2- 
	I was very pleased

                                    - 2- 
	I was very pleased to receive "The Service Men's News." I want to thank you very much.
	There really isn't much more for me to say, and I haven't much time to express anything I have on my mind, as most of time is taken up with studies
	That's about all for now, So until some time in the future I'll say "So-long"
                                                              Sincerely yours,
