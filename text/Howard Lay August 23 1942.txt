Dear Miss Thompson: 

	I wish to thank you for going to all the trouble of finding out about college correspondence courses for me.  I am going to write to the ones you advised immediately for their Extension and Correspondence bulletin's.  I'll be interested in that item you noticed in the paper concerning the University of the Army being planned by the US. Office of Education and the War Dept. 
	The weather up here at Chanute has suddenly turned cool and it has us boys from the southern camps fairly shivering.  I guess I'll have to let my blood thicken up again.
	Yesterday in school during one of the breaks who should walk up to me but Halp Pvh a last years senior at Newark State.  He is studying to be a civilian instructor in "Engine Repairs."
	This teaching methods course I'm taking here should help me when I return to school when this mess is over. 
	I should finish this course about the 26[th] of September then I'll be returning to Keesler Field, Miss. to spend the winter in the South. 
	Thank you again Miss Thompson, I'll let you know what I learn from these different colleges.
               
               Sincerely yours, 
               Howard R Lay
