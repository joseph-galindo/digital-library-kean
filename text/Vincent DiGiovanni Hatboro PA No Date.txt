Dear Miss Thompson:-

As per my promise to you, I am enclosing the addresses of our two very good friends.

A/C Henry Barone
Squadron 94
S.A.A.A.B.
Santa Ana, Cal.

Lt. Vincent Sarnowski
O.O.R.P.
Aberdeen Proving Grounds Md.

If these two knew of the fine work you are doing for the boys in service, I'm quite sure they'll regret not informing you of their whereabouts. As for me, I'm taking my final physical next week and I hope my knee can pass the exam. In all events, thank you for your kindness and I'll inform you wherever I'm sent.

Sincerely,

Vincent DiGiovanni
