Dear Miss Thompson,

A belated Merry Christmas and Happy New Year to you and everyone else on the faculty. I do hope I will be able to see you soon but I have my doubts! I've just been classified as a bombardier; I also qualified for pilot training, but the Army Air Corps decided I would make a better bombardier. I was really worried for awhile, the tests are really tough, in some respects at least.

I would like very much to know if any of the "gang" are in Air Crew training  -  if so I'd like to compare notes on training etc. Let me know will you. The curtain is going up on the critical act of my army career and I really could use a few hints.

By the way in your last letter you spoke about a rumour involving Anna Belle Lee and (?), well who is (?) and what am I supposed to know about it  -  maybe I was just an innocent bystander (could be, you know). Speaking of romances don't be too surprised to hear of one involving yours truly and an ex-librarian, now a Marine Corps. It isn't official as yet, so mum's the word huh! (also I have to save some dough for the necessary ring etc).

Don't ever ever let anyone tell you that Nashville is a nice clean town  -  it is neither nice and is as far from clean as any place could possibly be.

Sincerely

Bill Harrell
