UNITED STATES ARMY AIR FORCES

3 June 1945

Dear Miss Thompson,

At last I have finally finished my training and am headed out. I am really very glad  -  my only regret is that I wasn't able to get home once more  -  I did so want to but you know the Army.

I have enjoyed my stay here very much  -  California is really a wonderful state  -  I sometimes wonder if I wouldn't like to live out here after the war.

I haven't heard from the college in quite awhile I wonder what is doing back there? Are you having a summer session this year? Remember the good times we had that summer I went to the summer session. You, Walt, the girls, and I  -  I'll never forget them.

Who could have guessed what time would bring to that merry group  -  joy, love and tears. So much of living in a space of time. Enough memories for a lifetime.

I am going into combat with one of the finewst crews a fellow could ask for. All of them are really a wonderful bunch, they come from all corners of the nation, the deep South, the East Coast, the mid west, the far west, yet a more friendly coordinated and understanding group could not have been collected.

Well write soon and tell me all the old school's latest news.

Sincerely yours

Bill Harrell
