Dear Friends:
	I would like to thank you sincerely for the kindly gesture you have shown to me and all the other boys in the service who are N.J.S.T.C. men.
	The memorabilia brought back to me many a pleasant memory of good "ole N.J.S.T.C".
	This copy will travel with me whichever I go, and in my spare moments of relaxation I will page through the book reviewing the past so's I wouldn't forget it. And at the same time boost up the morale in case of depression when one will be in a tight spot.
	Once again thanking all of you who have worked so earnestly and having dedicated the book to us I remain as ever
                                                                  Your friend:
                                                                  Chet Kuizora

P.S.
In return we in the service will perform our duty as demanded of us.
