AMERICAN RED CROSS
France
January 25, 1945

Dear Miss Thompson,

I don't know whether you've heard the scandalous news from Dr. Vaughn. Earnes or not, but I've been hospitalized with the mumps. Yes, Clausen was determined to get a full face somehow, and so the result was the mumps. I'm feeling a good deal better now and expect to be back to normal soon.

France is still quite strange to me. I haven't had much opportunity to see much. England had a great deal of interest for me. I visited London once, and I enjoyed even in its war-time dullness. I especially enjoyed Bath with its almost ancient atmosphere. The Roman Baths have been preserved and are open to the public. Pub life is wild and definitely contrary to the day time reserve of the British. I even got into the old fish and chips habit.

I'm more interested in teaching than ever, and now I'm all ready to come back to Newark State as soon as I get out of the Army. I enjoy the editions of the camp news so much. It's swell keeping track of all the boys. The other night I put myself to sleep going over the men's show. That was quite an affair, wasn't it? It would be nice to put on a return show when we get back. I hope most of our old boys come back to Newark. The male population ought to be pretty good after the war. 

Meanwhile it's "on to Berlin" and then "on to Newark."

Let me hear from you. News from the college is always welcome.

Sincerely,

Bob
