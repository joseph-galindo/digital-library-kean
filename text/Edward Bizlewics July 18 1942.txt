Dear Miss Thompson,

Received your most welcomed card today. It make me feel swell to hear that you still remember Joe and I, at least for a little while anyway. It seems that Joe O' shipped out of Fort Dix, a day before I did. I left on Wednesday July 8 at 9:00 A.M. We arrived at Miami Beach, on Thursday July 9, at 5:00P.M.

Since that time, I've been enjoying the pleasant scenery of Miami and surrounding countryside.

Well, so far, Army life has been very agreeable with me. As the days go by, I actually enjoy the routine of army life. 

I have taken a few more tests down here, and I did very well on them. From the test, I qualified to go to one of four schools; the Aviation Mechanic Engine School, Photography School, Aircraft Machinist School, or Radio School. 

I picked the Aviation Mechanics Engine School. I hope I can make the grade.

I'll be in to see you on my first furlough, which I think will be in about 4 or 5 months from now. It looks like you will have to keep changing your service map. I won't be here long! 

Ed Bizlewics
