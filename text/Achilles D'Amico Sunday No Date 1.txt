Hi-ya Honey!

Okay, register me, too! The prodigal son is now a Corporal and finds himself in a swell outfit. No tea-tottlers or ping-pong experts, just big dumbs yeggs. We've travelled down the east coast to Florida and now sit on the brink of the Gulf of Mexico.

As for my physical being, I've 192 lbs, 5'10" and blacker than black. Someday I'll stand still enough to take a picture and then send you a copy. 

How's Miss Kain? Who is her new protector, I'm jealous  -  I guess you know by now the terrible triumverate  -  Panmullo, Rigley and I are now all in this fracas but quite distant from each other. How I would love to have Lt. Panmullo give me an order  -  

Incidently, I have enough time to improve my Conga and Rumba with the nearby Mexican lassies. Yes sir  -  back in the groove  -  

Well, keep grinding out school teachers, because one of them will have to support me when I fget out  - 

Sincerely,

Al
