To all you at the college,

Don't think that my failure to write means I have forgotten you. I have often recalled all of you, if not as individuals, at least as the "Student Body" and faculty, gathered in the gym, auditorium, lunch room or passing through the halls. I have even tried to picture those of you whom I have never met.

Christmas is a good time to let people know you remember them. Hence, the "Christmas Card" and this note. The "card", as the product of a former student, may cause the Art and English departments to "lose face", as we say in the Orient  but it was the best I could do at the moment. I hope it reaches you by Christmas. Unfortunately I couldn't get it off earlier due to the fact that I have been moving around China via foot and mule. As you can imagine not only my feet hurt, but I was sorely pressed from another angle , as well.

My special greeting to the Reflector staff. I've heard that although hard hit by the war you will continue to function. Good luck. Incidently I haven't seen a Reflector in months. If you have any extra copies lying around I would certainly appreciate receiving one.

Sincerely,

Ed
