	Dear Miss Thompson,
	I am in receipt of the May issue of the Service Men's News. As usual it was sent to the wrong place. This of course is my own fault. I should have dropped you some sort of line to let you know my where-abouts.
	During the past four months I have been undergoing training as a first pilot on the B-24 Liberator bomber. Having successfully completed this training --- I am awaiting reassignment. What this new assignment  will be, I have no idea.
	The field, at which I am now stationed is due to close the 30[th] of this month --- so I imagine I will be on my merry way again very soon.
	We have been enjoying very nice weather here in the South land, which has enabled us to do quite a bit of swimming.
	As I have mentioned before, I am not much good at letter writing, and if I was  -  there isn't too much to write about. The main reason that I sat down to scribble off this little note, was to let you know how much I enjoy receiving and reading the S.M.N. Pleased continue having it printed and make sure I always receive a copy. Thanks --------
                                                              Sincerely yours,
                                                            George F. McCarthy
