Dear Miss Thompson,

Please forgive my brief notes but I don't have time for longer letters  -  things are moving much too fast. Thanks for the addresses  -  it was just what I wanted but I was afraid to ask for them all at once.

I was horrified at the news about Ed Ambry's(spelling?) sister, I knew her quite well and always considered her a very fine person, is the news about her definite? No hope? Let me know if you can.

I am going to write a letter to Dr. Downes tonight and tell her all about our education program. I don't know if I'll tell her my marks or not  -  I'll decide later. Anyway ask her to show you the letter  -  that is if you are interested (and I'm sure you are?). I am also sending you a few papers that we use or have used that might be of general interest around college  -  I hope so anyway.

Sincerely

Bill Harrell

P.S. I just remembered that you were asking about Fred Hoffman. The last time I saw him, he had just been let out of the hospital after having an appendicitis operation. I imagine that he is either still at Atlantic City or else at Jefferson Barracks where the rest of our squadron went.

Bill
