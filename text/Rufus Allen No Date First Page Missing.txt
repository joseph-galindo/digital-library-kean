                          U.S. NAVAL TRAINING SCHOOL
                          (AVIATION RADIO MATERIAL)
                            CORPUS CHRISTI, TEXAS
                                       
Corpus Christi, my present station, is an air base. The city is 100,000 & looks like Newark. It has palms & other tropical growth & the weather is swell. The lads play touch football in bathing suits.

They work you pretty hard 7:30a.m. to 8:30p.m.  -  time out for meals. Grass is nice and green & morning glories are blooming in front of our barracks.

New Year's we worked; we had sea-gull for dinner (Seagull is chicken here).

All day long the planes fly, circle, formations, & sometimes the air is filled with them. 

I serve directly under Lt. Comdr. N.H. Randall who is quite a man. He was aboard the first action of the U.S. Navy in 1917 & was at Pearl Harbor that 7[th] of Dec.

Will close now, Remember me to Miss Engola, Mr. Sloan & Miss Baldwin. I think those are all the teachers there whom I know that are still there.

If you see any of my old classmates or former teachers remember me to them.

With kindest regards, I am very sincerely yours,

Rufus B. Allen
