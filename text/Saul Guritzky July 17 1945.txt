Faculty,

Since the war in Europe has ended I have been doing a little traveling via airplane.

At present our group is transporting the freight and personnel of a fighter group to Germany. Its different now when we fly over Germany, no flak or fighters, just peace and quiet  -  however when we landed we all carry 45 automatic pistols for personal protection  -  just in case of trouble.

The German beer isn't bad and besides I am learning German.

Our group is slated for occupational work  -  and a tour of continental Europe.

I engaged the last issue of "Servicemen's News" it brought back some of the good old days.

The more I see of this World, the more I am convinced that the U.S.A. is the only place for me.

Sincerely,

Saul Guritzky
