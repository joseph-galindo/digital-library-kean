Dear Miss Thompson,

After getting myself adjusted to this place I finally have found enough time to write you a letter with a little detail to it. I suppose I could have written sooner, but then I wouldn't have known what to say. After arriving here on Monday, April 5, I was assigned to a barracks, and then I had a good night sleep. The next day we were assigned government insurance policies for ten thousand dollars. The following day we took a 7 hour mental exam which started at 8a.m. and we were finished at 4 a.m. It was really rugged but I don't think I did too bad on it though. The following day we took a psycho-motor test which was a test of muscular coordination. Monday comes the physical fitness test, and I hear its really a humdinger. If I pass through that I can really consider myself in. But I'm still a little leery of myself and I'm not quite certain that I'll make it. All I can do is to try my best, and take everything in stride. Nothing else of importance to say, so I'll close. My new address is as follows:

Av/C Edward Bizlewicz
A.A.F.C.C.     S.A.A.C.C.
Squadron 105 Flight F
San Antonio, Texas

Did Bob (Illegible) ever get home on furlough? If he ever does, give him my regards.

Your truly,

Ed
