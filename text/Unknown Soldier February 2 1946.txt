Dear Miss Thompson,
	Its wonderful of our college planning a home-coming for those of us that were connected with this past struggle and I'm very sorry not to be in a position to attend. I know the affair will be a huge success as are all our N.S.T.C. gatherings. Thanks loads for the personal note on the bottom of the invitation and I will also take this opportunity to answer it. I am not married yet, but hope to be in the very near future.
	My ship at present is in San Diego Harbor awaiting decommissioning. What plans they Navy has for me until my separation I do not know. In the meantime I am enjoying Navy life while you poor civilians squirm under shortages caused by all the present day strikes. My vacation will be up sometime late this spring when I will return to civilian life and teaching. Please remember me to my buddies and classmates and I'm hoping to see them soon. I am enclosing a copy of the citation which we earned at Iwo Jima, for your record. Although I have another commendation from Admiral Spruance when we were working with the Fifth Fleet. I value this one above all because it is an award to our group and not an individual.
	The world is at last beginning to realize that through education and understanding can man hope to settle his problems. We as educators shoulder that tremendous responsibility today and it is our duty to foster and develop that understanding within the present generation for that is what those who gave and never came back expect of us.

Sincerely,
Bill Schwartz
