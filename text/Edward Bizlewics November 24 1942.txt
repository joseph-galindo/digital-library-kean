28[th] A.D.G Repair Sq.

Dear Miss Thompson,

After a pleasant two day trip on the train, we finally arrived in San Antonio, late in the night. The next day, we were assigned to the 28[th] Repair Outfit. In reality we can be compared as miners for the army, for we salvage all the useable parts from damaged airplanes, and use them on airplanes that are forced down behind front lines. In actual combat we will be riding, and working in "Machine Shops on Wheels." We are now being trained in that type of work, and it won't be long before I have an A.P.O. address.

Camp life here is very pleasant, and to (illegible) right now, it feels like a vacation after being in school for 15 weeks. The officers here are really swell, and they always give you a decent break.

We live in huts, with six men to a hut. The huts are as big as tents, except they are made of plywood. We have a gas stove in the center, and it really come in handy when the night get cool. On the whole, the weather here is rather warm, and on days after a heavy rain, it tends to get chilly, but not cold.

I'm applying for cadet training here, but find I need a few letters of recommendation. I was wondering if you could help me out on the matter. If you could send it to me as soon as possible I will be able to take my test sooner. 

If I stay in the West too long, I'm afraid I'm going to acquire a Western drawl. Most of the men here are from Texas, and from the time I get up, till I go to bed at night, the fellows keep drawling all over the place.

Well, if I'm home for Christmas, I drop around for little visit.

Yours truly,

Edward
