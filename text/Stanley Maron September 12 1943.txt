Dear Faculty and Students,
	This September brings back fond recollections of another September one year ago. Those remembrances are very keen and I miss N.J. S.T.C greatly.
	I am now located at Fort Benning down here in Georgia. I am in the  A.S.T.P. program and if I can satisfactorily complete my Basic Training I shall be selected to go to college to study Engineering.
	At present I am in the fourth week of my training. It's tough work and we are out in an average temperature of over 100Â°, but it's great stuff and we like it. There is a fine bunch of fellows here, almost all are college men.
	I have met a few very interesting ones and even a ministerial aspirant. You can imagine the time I had with him. We have been able to have some very good discussions, which always helps to pep things up.
	We have everything here that we could want in the way of facilities. There is a large Gym, Two swimming pool right on the Main Post Service Club, etc. etc. We are kept very busy but should we get any free time we are able to put it to good use. Incidentally the Training we are Taking is in the Infantry Training School which is equivalent to OCS.
