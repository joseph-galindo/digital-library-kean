Dear Mr. Hutchinson



	If there is anyone who warrants a letter from me, it is you. The reason I sat this is because during my four years at college, I always held you in high esteem as a teacher, secondly because you and I were part of a fraternity whose fine aim was social and educational equality irrelevant of religion; and third because I always thought of you as a friend.
	Now, I find myself a full pledged member of the U.S. Air Corp stationed at Miami Beach, Florida. I am very fortunate to be in the branch of the service. At the moment, I have been chosen to attend the aviation technical school to train for the position of radio operator and mechanic [partially covered by tape]. I know it is a far cry from teaching but I'm glad in the knowledge that I am [slightly illegible] doing my small share in speeding our country to quick victory.
	I would be indebted to you if you would give the faculty members my sincerest regards since I think of them quite often. If at anytime, you find time in your convenience to drop me a card letting me know how the faculty, my fraternity brothers and student friends are, it would be appreciated.
Best of luck for the coming New Year and Victory.

Keep `em flying.

	
	Thoughtfully yours,

	George Kliman
