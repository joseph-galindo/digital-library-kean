Dear Miss Thompson,

Please forgive my tardyness in writing but I have been on the move again  -  this time I wound up in California  -  I like the school very much even if I am working my fool(sp?) head off. The food is marvelous and the chef makes real honest-to-goodness N.J.S.T.C. meat loaf a la Campbell.

The trip west was really something to behold  -  we had stops at San Antonio, El Paso, Yuma, the Salton Sea, Ando(sp?), San Bernardino, and Victorville. The Salton Sea is the barest place I have ever seen  -  all that water and absolutely no vegetation. The Sea is the lowest point on the American continent, some 200 feet below sea level. There are high snow capped mountains in the background. Speaking of mountains, the ones around here are the most peculiar (to me), they have no, or very little, vegetation and are composed of huge piles of rock (or so it looks from a distance. They remind me of the slog piles, only much higher, back East.

I ran into Ralph Sozzio at Loredo the last week I was there. He is in the Post band. Here is his address. Write to him  -  I know he isn't any too happy with his lot  -  but don't let on I said so.

Pfc Ralph Sozio
642[nd] A.A.F. Band
L.A.A.F.
Laredo, Texas

Well I guess that is about all for now.
