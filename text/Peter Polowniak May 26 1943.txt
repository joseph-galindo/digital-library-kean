Hello  -  from away out here  -  do you suppose I could get some of the boy's addresses who might out this way  -  some with San Francisco post office addresses. It certainly would be nice to talk over alma mater with some one from our dear old institution.

I'm out here in the southwest Pacific on a beautiful island  -  funny I can't see any beauty in it.  -  Do you know anyone who might be interested in working there way through a tropical island  -  let me know - they sure can have it. & keep making those news sheet  -  make good reading honest  - 

Regards  - 

Peter P.
