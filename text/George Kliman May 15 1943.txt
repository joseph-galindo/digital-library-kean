Dear Faculty and Friends- 

	It's a grand life that I've spent these last two months in the state of California.

	I still keep `em flying on the B-25's. Air Force radio work sure agrees with me. I'm leaving for another air base this week. My best regards to you, all my friends.

				Yours Californially,
