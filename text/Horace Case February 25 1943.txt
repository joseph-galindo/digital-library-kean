Feb 25, 1943

I received the issue of the Servicemens paper that you sent out a week or so ago and I was very glad to get it. It is the first time in five months that I have had any idea just what was going on at N.J.S.T.C.

I realize that I have been very lax in notifying you of my where about so I will take this opportunity to tell you that I am now located at Camp Davis North Carolina trying my luck at the Officers Candidate School. I have been here since a few days before Xmas and if all goes well I shall be out of here by April as a second lieutenant in the anti-aircraft artillery. However I am not "counting chickens" because there are too many places along the line where a person can be dropped out.

Just to keep your records up to date I now rank Corporal even though my present title is candidate. My address at the moment is

Candidate Horace Case
Battery 34 Anti Aircraft School
Officer Candidate Division
First Platoon
Camp Davis N.C.

I will have to stop now and get back to studying (for a change) so I'll say so long.

Here's to an early victory,

Horace Case
