My dear Miss Thompson,

I received your Christmas card last week but I've been just too busy to write letters. We moved to a new location New Year's Day and soon after we settled in the building. I was made supply sergeant and given a full load of headaches and trouble. Not only did I have to set up the supply room but I also had to get my records up to date for an inspection. I'm just beginning to see the end of the struggle and then I'll be able to relax and draw two consecutive days breathe and answer my correspondence.

We are in barracks built by Mussolini for his air-borne troops. We occupy the first floor of a 3 floored stone barracks with other cos. occupying the other floors. We have electricity and running water in the building. This is the most comfortable I've been since I left the US.

Regards to all the faculty and I hope I shall be seeing you soon.

Bernard
