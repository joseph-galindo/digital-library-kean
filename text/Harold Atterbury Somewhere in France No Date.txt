Had a rather pleasant voyage, all factors considered. It wasn't what we'd ordinarily think of as the epitome of comfort but on the other hand we experienced no severe storms and the Krauts didn't (illegible) us with unwelcome attention.

We're pop tenting and sleeping close to the good earth  -  not that I've seen anything so far that deserves that adjective tho! They can give this stuff back to the keeper(sp?) I'll take my gumbo in a stew.

You may have quite a job on your hand, re-educating some of us to more sanitary standards  -  we wear our clothes until they stand at "attention" automatically & as for bathing  -  hmph! With all the fresh air around (illegible) a little thing like BO is hardly likely to cause wrinkled noses or arched eyebrows. Still!!

Washing one's face, shaving, brushing your teeth are all accomplished by using your bonnet  -  in more ways than one. Of course our headgear doesn't sum to the extreme of shaving fancy do that our year-round shapean(sp?) really does a nice job.  Â¶ Bye now. Harold.
