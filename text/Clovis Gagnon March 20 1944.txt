Dear Friends at Newark State;

My "Service Men's News" has reached me after considerable travel. I have been in England for some time and have done a fair amount of traveling. As yet I haven't been given a definite assignment, so the address I'm giving you is temporary. I will advice you of my new addresses as soon as I receive it.

England is a pretty country and the people are much as I expected to find them. The rationing has impressed me. We are all anxiously awaiting the big push. 

Hope to find time to write more soon.

Sincerely,

Clovis R. Gagnon
