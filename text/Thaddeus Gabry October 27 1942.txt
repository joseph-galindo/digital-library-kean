Dear Miss Thompson  -  

Dame fortune has once again smiled on one of the Gabry clan with a promotion to first lieutenant as of October 19.

I would appreciate very much the latest address of Arthur Earl, class of '41 and one copy of the latest Reflector.

Please remember me to all members of the faculty and student body.

Sincerely,

Lt. Ted Gabry
Class `41
