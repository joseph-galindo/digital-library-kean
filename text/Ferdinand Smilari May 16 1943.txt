Dear Dr. Schaeffer,

As you probably know, I've been recently transferred from Keesler Field, Mississippi to the University of Pittsburgh's great "Cathedral of Learning".

Dr. Schaeffer, I am extremely anxious to attend graduation exercise, and receive my diploma personally. However, an ordinary pass will not enable me to travel more than fifty miles from the school. The week-end pass that I would need might be available if the reason is sufficiently valid. It is my hope that a letter from you to the commanding officer might bear sufficient weight for me to have the privilege granted. It is needless to say what this favor would mean to my parents.

Would you please mail to me an enclosed letter requesting such a pass from the commanding officer?

Thank you for your consideration in this matter.

                                                           Respectfully yours,
                                                         a/s Ferdinand Smilari
