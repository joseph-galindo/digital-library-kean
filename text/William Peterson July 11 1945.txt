Dear Miss Thompson, P
	
	Prior to supper I mailed a letter to you, but forgot to enclose the article I mentioned. Am doing so now.

	Immediately after supper your V mail of June 9[th] arrived  -  2 days later than yours of June 20. Such is our mail situation

	I realize how much of your time is taken with duties as well as incidentals at school and I hold no hard feeling toward anyone (in case you had gotten that impression.). My faith is as strong now if not stronger than ever before, but people believing untruths is more than I can stand  -  especially when it concerns me.

	I have a letter from Regina Jorski tonite also. What a sense of humor she has, but alas, her conception of France as it deals with me is wrong -! But what a sense of humor she has  -  oo- la- la!!!

	Miss Thompson  -  what is a sense of humor?

	Just wanted you to know your letters are here. Thanks much
								   Bill
