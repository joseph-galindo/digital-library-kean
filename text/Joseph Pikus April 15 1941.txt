Dear Miss Thompson,
	I haven't written to you sooner, because I wanted to write to you about things that I am doing, how that I have things to do; I have little time to write. The Army is like that.
	I was [illegible; shanglrid?] out to Fort Eustis, Virginia about a week ago. This is a replacement  [illegible; Anter?] when unqualified privates (Jups in slang) are shipped to be trained during a 13 week period. [illegible; Over or Our?] Specialty is [illegible; Crort?] Artillery and I'm in a [illegible; seaveblight?] battery -- [illegible; was?] intended. I don't know what my specific tasks will be as yet. To-late I've [iilegible; carried?] [illegible; cables?] and to-day, I was [illegible; presented?] to carrying a heavier piece of equipment. Perhaps, by to-morrow I'll be [illegible; remanded?] and permitted to carry the heaviest piece of material, but then o forget that I am a table waiten to-morrow.
	Our [illegible; nist?] [illegible; cneists?] of from [illegible; pieces?]. A sound location which [illegible;picks?] [illegible] the [illegible; srends?] of incoming every planes, a [illegible; corteal?] station when [illegible; buttons?] induce [illegible; autenatoi] [illegible; respones? ] from equipment c [illegible; pause?] plant which [illegible; funnishes?] electricity, and [illegible; frially?] a 60 [illegible; such or sich?] [illegible; dunm?]  type [illegible; seaveblight?] which has 8,000,000 candlepower. It is capable of picking up a plan 5 or 6 miles distant in atmosphere such as in this [illegible; vicinity?]. In Hawaii, when the atmosphere is more free from in [illegible; puniteis?], [illegible] how spotted planes 15 miles out. O an instruction has consisted of [illegible; momenelatum?] and not principles as I guess Mr. [illegible; Burne?] will have to finish that.
	Miss Thompson, [illegible; we're?] a million miles from no place. Actually, we're 10 miles from Williamsburg; 11 miles from Newport [illegible; News?] and about 56 miles from Virginia Beach. yorktown is about in th general neighborhood.
	Although, it's too early to make judgments, my opinion is that the majority of boys don't like it here. First, this too far from home: second, they [illegible; lul?] that won is impending; third, that they may be kept in longer than [illegible mark; ` ?] you; and fourth, as this is a brand new [illegible; center?]. [illegible; ucreational?] [illegible; foreibiteis?] are a yet non-existant.
	at Dix, I had a fright with my corporal. He came in drunk one night at 4:00 A.M. Plopped into a wet bed arranged by an of his cromis and then insisted that one of my bunkmates, a meek [illegible; Hungonion?] in this county but 4 years, [illegible; swnesles?] his [illegible]. I told him to "lay off". "Oh yeah", said he, as he tore the [illegible; couhes?] off me, "Set Out!" We had a [illegible; tunnel?] and he went to sleep in this own cut. The next morning, I had to sweep and mop, as a [illegible]. [illegible; Junteri?] [illegible; triumped?] however, as he was confined to quarters by the commanding officer then no instigation on my part. They must have heard the noise.
	In [illegible; doing?], I'm going to beg. We have a [illegible; bulleteis?] board on which Draftee [illegible; Articles?] and [illegible; cartron?]  world be swell. Is it [illegible; powlel?]? Will you [illegible;carrey?] my [illegible; bindert?] [illegible] [illegible] to Miss [illegible; Figson?]? 
Your friend, 
Joe
