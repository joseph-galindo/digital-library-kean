Dear Miss Thompson,

Since writing last, I have been east on two surveys. I returned from the second one just a week ago. I spent three days at Wright in Paterson. As much as I wanted to stop in, I just couldn't find time. I had one evening to myself and managed to get to Hacketstown. My folks would be very disappointed if I didn't stop in.

We have a new group of officers with us. After two weeks of training they will be assigned to plants not covered by officers from our unit. One of these is Curtiss Propeller Co. in Caldwell. My work now is more of a supervisory nature. Still I manage to get out and meet a lot of grand people in these plants. 

With production increasing our unit is becoming more important. Of course a lot depends on how well we do our work. As long as we are at peak production there will be critical items. So we'll take each component and schedule it so that it gets to the right place at the right time.

For the past two week I have been living in the [illegible]. It is convenient to the down town social life. Then too there are the recreation facilities of the [illegible] to keep a person from getting fat.

Thanks again for writing. I'll try to drop in on my next trip east.

Sincerely

Ray Kowalick
