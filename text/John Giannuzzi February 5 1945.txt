The Philippine Islands

Feb-5-1945

Dear Miss Thompson:

This is a poor excuse for a letter, but I know that if I continue to default in writing, you will think that I have forgotten you and our school, and this would not be so. Miss Thompson, I have been here for quite some time, and have been able to add to my experiences. At present things are pretty quiet and I find myself eager to be on the move. Upon arrival there was plenty of work to be done, and everyone took part in doing his share. This was in the nature of setting up a camp and making the place livable. I am now working nights in the photogrammetry section, doing mapping. This work is very interesting and keeps us busy.

I have made some observations of the people, and general conditions which should prove valuable for open discussions when I return.

Received a copy of "Service Men's News" a short time ago. (Nov. issue) I sure look forward to getting it, and read every word. Glad to know that so many of my former schoolmates are doing so well in the service.  -  I'll try to write long letter soon. Remember me to everyone.

Enclose find some Jap-invasion money. (6 bills)

A hopeful soldier

John
