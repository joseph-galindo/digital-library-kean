Dear Miss Thompson:

	After spending a year and a half in Corpus Christi am now on the way out to the West Coast.

	I received your many nice bulletins and in the last I noted a reference to Lieut. Charlie Dilks.

	I was going to write in then, but thought it would be more approp-riate later. As an en-listed man, I think the Navy will go a long ways before a finer officer can be found. He was my Company Commander for a long time (many months), and had a terrific respons-ibility as well as a stack of work a mile high as head of the training dept.

	He is doing a swell job; the men admire and respect him and there isn't a better and more technically qualified officer to be found.

	I can say that freely as I'm out of his command now, but I'd go into action any time under his leadership. They don't come any better and that goes for every lad in the barracks, because they think of him in even more glowing terms.

	Well Corpus & Ward Is were 100%. I finally stopped being librarian and got a better job. I am yeoman 1[st] cl. now & passed the physical for sea duty, which isn't bad at 51.

	Miss school some but everything is O.K.

	Regards to any of the faculty about. This writing is fierce, but I'm on a crowded troop train, - sailors, soldiers & marines,

	Goodbye & I'll drop you a line first time I do anything worth writing about as change my station.

Sincerely yous,

Rufus B. Allen

P.S. Thanks a lot for everything. Will send you my new address when I learn what it is.

Thank you for your swell little paper. It's good to know N.S.T.C. is in there slugging. Scuse the figure of speech  -  it's more picturesque than appropriate but conveys the idea. R.
