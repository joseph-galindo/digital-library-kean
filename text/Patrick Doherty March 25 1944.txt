25 March 1944

Dear Miss Thompson:

Received the January edition of the News and as usual scanned it eagerly for news of my old buddies.

In my gulliver-like travels about Afrique du Nord I managed to run across my old friend Bob Behrendt. Naturally old times were relived, aided and abetted by sips of the local beverage alleged to be champagne. It seemed strange that Bob and I should stand on the deck of his ship and talk about those we knew and the things we planned to do "Apres la guerre". As Bob put it after reciting some of his experiences, "this war is going to make school teaching seem rather dull to us for a while."

Do you have a better mailing address for Murray Brooks, Wesley Lyons and Bob Ford? I would like to contact those old ∑ΘΧ'ers.

Inclosed are six pictures taken since I arrived in the Arabs playground.

Regards to all

Pat
