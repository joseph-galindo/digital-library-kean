UNITED STATES ARMY AIR FORCES

17 November 1943

Dear Miss Thompson,

Well I finally have started to fly  -  today was my first flight and I'll never forget it. We only have Piper Cubs and Ka[y]det Interceptor(?) but they'll do until a better is available.

Do you still print the Servicemen's News? I was wondering I haven't received one for quite a spell.

Sincerely

Bill Harrell
