Dear Dr. Powers,

     I thought I'd drop you a line to let you know how everything is out here.  As you can see from my address, I am not too far away from home.  You will probably be interested to know what I am doing in the Air Corps.
     It seems like old times as I am going to school.  My course is considered by Air Corps officials as the hardest to master.  I do hope I will be able to write to you in January and say, I've passed the course!  
     The course title is `Link Trainer Instruction'.  The title doesn't make sense to you, I know, so I'll try to explain as best as possible.  
     After graduation I will be transferred to an air field to act as an instructor.  Our job will consist of teaching pilots how to read instruments and how to fly blind (blind flying).  Before we are qualified to do this I must know more than he does about flying.  Actually we never get our feet off the ground.
     Our training is with a trainer plane that never leaves the ground but instrument controls simulate that we are.  These planes are wonderful mechanisms.
     Well, I think I've said enough as time is flying and studying time is valuable.


Yours Sincerely,
     Ted Lucciola
