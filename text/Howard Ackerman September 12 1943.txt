Dear Miss Thompson,
	Just wrote to let you know of a change in address.
	I am now at Compton Junior College, where I just passed the exams for engineering in the Army Specialized Training Program. I am now taking refresher courses, and will continue taking them until there is an opening at some college or university where I will begin my real work.
	Please give my regards to everyone.
Sincerely yours,
Pvt. Howard Ackerman
