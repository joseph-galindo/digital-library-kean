THIRD W.A.A.C. TRAINING CENTER
FORT OGLETHORPE, GEORGIA

                                                                 March 6, 1943
                                                                              
Dear Dr. Shea:

Hello.

I suppose you despaired of ever having me write to you from the W.A.A.C.s and asking you how you and your husband are.

Dr. Shea, I can't just say thank you for your effort in the preliminaries of my application, but it will have to suffice. Perhaps some day, some how, there will be a way I can thank everybody and rest with an air of accomplishment. Thank you, somehow, is inadequate. What shall we do, Dr. Shea?

At present just the idea of arriving here and training is overwhelming. The fort was an old cavalry post in World War I and during this war the [illegible] marshal conducted a school for the military police, and now it is a W.A.A.C. training center. We are considered pioneers, although everything is quite well organized, one never wants for company or entertainment.

This company is speckled with teachers from many states. One of the women was a civil engineer. What annoys me is my failure in being anything. They had trouble classifying me. My working on a newspaper and doing everything in a department store is the strangest combination. Then they kept asking me what I did when I was out of school! Perhaps they'll classify me as a career student-master-of-no-trade. As you know I'm among the babes-in-arms.

So long for awhile, 

Sincerely,

Regina
