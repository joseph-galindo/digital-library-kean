Dear Miss Thompson,

Hello again  -  yes, I'm still here in this beautiful country location, and in very good spirits. Life has become a bit more exciting over here, as allied progress is being made. And as time goes on, our news will be filled with more reports of liberated areas.

I hope this brief note finds you, the faculty and the student body in good health. Here's to a quick reunion for all our boys, and may they all return home safely.

Yours sincerely,

George
