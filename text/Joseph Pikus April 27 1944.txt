Dear Miss Nancy Thompson,
	Just a [illegible; nats?] to tell you that I'm still at Shelly and [illegible; laming?] my salary. [illegible; Senir?] Lt. Musgrave is away at school I've been pulling [illegible; lath?] shifts and its [illegible; hept?] me happing.
	An Inspecting [illegible; Offecis?] was breathing down my neck for two days and since it's the first time that I have been th [illegible; usponsihl?] [illegible; Offeris?], I'm huping my [illegible; Fengies?] Crossed [illegible; until?] the formal [illegible; upart?] [illegible; utusis?] from atlanta.
	Thank you very much for th newsletter. I don't believe that th American Medical Association, [illegible; Leshhein?]  [illegible;it al?] world argue with you in calling us practicing psychiatrists. Although I [illegible] I [illegible] use [illegible; pentahal?] or sodium [illegible; amytal?] on [illegible; sene?] of the birds that come through this station.
	This week's funny incident [illegible] a feebleminded boy who couldn't count. "How much is 5 and 5, I said? "Eleven", he said. "New look", I said. "How many [illegible; fengirs] do you have on your right hand?" "Five", he said. "Well, how many do you have on both hands?" "Eleven", he said. "How many do you have on your left hand?" "Six", he said. And I'll be damned if he didn't have six [illegible; fengirs?].
Just in an [illegible; anoly?] [Illegible; g?] [illegible; nahus?].
As ever,
Joe
