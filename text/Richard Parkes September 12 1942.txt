Dear Dr. Shaffer; -- 
	I am replying to you in connection with the card you send to my son Richard, asking him to advise you regarding the position he now holds. 
	After graduation, Richard went to Camp Dix where he remained three days before going to Miami Beach for training.  After the course there was completed, he was sent to Denver, Colorado for further study.  His is studying photography, map making, ect., and expects to qualify for aerial photography or dark-room development work at the front line, so before long he no doubt will be in the thick of things. I'm glad to say that he is making splendid progress, all his marks to date being better than 90.  Which speaks well for the training he received at Newark State. 
	His address is Private Richard C. Parkes, U.S. Air Corp., 364[th] Technical School Squadron, Lowry Field (Barracks 659) Denver Colorado. 
                              Yours very truly, 
                                Clarence A. Parkes
