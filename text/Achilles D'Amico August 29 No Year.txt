Dearest Love! (Capital L)

Thanks for your reassuring letter. Things sure must have happened at NSTC. You asked me to write Miss Kain, and I would love to, but alas, no address. However, tell Ms. Kain for me, she better be prepared for a long enduring, passionate kiss from her bad boy when he returns. Boy we have been traveling fast. Here is one for the books! You'll never believe it, especially any of the Engineer minded people at NSTC (Mrs. Plenty).

The Black Sheep, corrupt politician, and revolutionist of NSTC put up the first pontoon bridge across the Sienne River. Our outfit is as proud or harder about it and only a few more creeks to go and I'm afraid Mr. Hitler will have to confess that the Yanks aren't a soft desk-ridden crew.

Thanks for sending my address to Canmillo. He was and always will be one of my staunchest friends. 

Now do me another favor. No, not a book report, please write to John telling him I've lost his address and then perhaps in your next letter, you'll send me his  - 

Got to stop now  -  Love - Al
