Home, Diapers
Their Worries

Otherwise GI Wives
From Abroad Find
Newark Is Fine


GI Wives who said they said they came to Newark, expecting to find a "land of plenty," have met complete disillusionment on only two scores- the housing shortage and `he black market in diapers.

A check of girls who are members of Newark's Overseas Wives Club yesterday showed that, aside from the two shortages, the brides are well contented with their adopted country. As one GI wife put it, "We'd love America- if we could only find a place to live."

Mrs. Rita Kliman, chairman of the club, said she and her husband, former Cpl. George Kliman, Newark School teacher, finally found an apartment at 74 Treacy Avenue, after living in a series of furnished rooms. Now they face another problem when Mrs. Kliman's mother and brother arrive from London next month to share their two  -  and  -  a  -  half rooms.

Food No Problem

Food shortages- even the recent meat [partially illegible] dearth  -  haven't bothered the British wives in the least, Mrs. Kliman said. "We have so much more here than we had in England that I didn't realize there was a shortage at all," she said. Even waiting in line at the butcher shop hasn't phased her, "In England we had to wait in line for a piece of fish, and fresh fruit, butter and eggs were practically unheard of," she said.  Formerly with the Eight Air Force, Mr. Kliman now teaches Seventh Grade at Avon Avenue School.
