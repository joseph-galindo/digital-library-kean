Dear Miss Thompson,

I recently received the latest issue of the bulletin concerning us in the service so I thought I'd write an express my appreciation for such. It is the only way that I can halfway keep track of those former acquaintences who are now in the armed forces.

I am just putting the finishing touches on pre-flight school (Navigator) and in a week or so should be starting advanced aerial navigation training. It's interesting and I only hope that I'll be able to do a good job. 

This is a good field but it's still Texas. Seems as if I'll never get out of Texas let alone get a furlough. They say the first year is the hardest, if that's so, I've put the worst behind me.

My regards to any who might remember me  -  

Sincerely

Donald P. Hoagland
