Dear Miss Thompson,

Received your letter which you sent to Purcell. I want to thank you very much. I also received the "News Letter." I really think the college is doing a wonderful job for the boys.

It looks like I will be stationed here at Pensacola for at least a year. Marion is joining me next week.

My work here is very interesting. I am assistant officer in charge of maintenance in Squadron #7. We have over 100 planes to keep flying. It is a very interesting job with lots of responsibility but really like it. 

I can go flying whenever I like and which I do quite often. It is very beautiful flying out over the Gulf and the water looks so nice and green below.

This is quite a large base and any (word missing) other boys from college are down this way. I'd sure like to get in touch with them.

Thanks again for the letter and the news letter it is always (word missing) to hear from you. 

Give my love to Miss (word missing), Mrs. Smith, yes you too.

Regards to all,
As ever,

Wally
