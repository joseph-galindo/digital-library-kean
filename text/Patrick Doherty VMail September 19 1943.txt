Dear Miss Thompson,

Thanks once more for the "Service Mens News". I received the June edition in Friday's mail. It certainly looks as tho the old homestead is reverting to its status of the last war  -  "all girl hermitage".

As you can see I have had another change of address. This time I have been adopted by an outfit. Gone, I hope, are my days in Replacement Depots, never more to return and haunt me. This unit is made up of Negroes whose job is the construction and maintenance of air fields. This is a large order, hence we are kept quite busy most of the time.

In my travels to date I have seen Casablanca, Oman, Mostaganam, and Algiers. Here's hoping that I see more of the battle sites before leaving Africa.

My present location is adjacent to an airport in an area which is constantly being swept by the much hated pirraccos. These demons of the deserts cast sand and dust into our plates at mealtime, into our beds, and into our eyes all the time.

Regards to all,

Pat
