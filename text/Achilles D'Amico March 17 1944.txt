Hello again  - 

Well I guess they can expect Hitler to quit any day now, now that our fighting Engineers have landed (ahem!). Seriously though, I hope if the big boys have something planned, I hope it happens now. Playing soldier boy for nearly three years get pretty monotonous after a while and I sure would like to stretch my legs underneath a desk again someday and say, "Good morning, children, I trust that you have all studied your lesson for today (because I haven't)."

I really can't say too much, but you may rest assured that England really has felt the war and the term rationing really has meaning here, not the way it is implied back home in the States. Well, getting close to the bottom now, and oh yes, visited Stratford-On-The-Avon and Oxford. So what!!

Love  -  Al
