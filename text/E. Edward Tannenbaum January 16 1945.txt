Dear Miss Lipson: -

Permit me to thank you for the lovely rememberence around Christmas time. I honestly thought you've really forgotten me.

First, let me start by telling you my new A.P.O. is 70. The post office is not off the boat yet; hence, we have no mail but we expect them in any day now. You see I came in with our hospital on the invasion. Its the largest island of the Philippine group. (Luzon)

We made the invasion and surprisingly is was easy but now that we've hit the mountains the going is tough. Funny too  -  this town has a railroad and nearly is a very large two lane concrete highway which is many miles long and leads to the center of things. I'm hoping I get to that huge center shortly.

The people are very happy that we've now come. They tip their hats to us and give us a very welcome  -  glad to see you.

Their day of liberation is here. People have very little clothes; in fact, I saw a girl with a dress made of burlap sugar sack with the print of American Sugar refining company on the back. I haven't seen any with shoes. They claim the Japs took all of their shoes.

People are very willing to work; however, they are learning the value of American money and always want more. Yet, they do your laundry nicely  -  that sure is a relief from doing it yourself. If there is one thing I hate to do  -  its my own laundry. Its good to see green grass again and listen to the crowing of the rooster in the morning. It would be swell if the big guns wouldn't make so much noise.

Hope you well. Regards to Miss Thompson, Miss Rice, Miss Lee and all the faculty. Lets hear from you.

Yours for quick victory
