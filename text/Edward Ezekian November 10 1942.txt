Dear Mrs. D'Angola,

I was certainly very surprised and very happy to hear from you. It was really an unexpected pleasure.

I was home for Armistice's Day  -  just one day. It was the seventh time I had been home so that's pretty good. I also got engaged to a Philadelphia girl on Armistice Day. So you see it was worth going home.

I've been very fortunate in that I've had invitations for every week-end to spend Saturday nights and Sundays at many homes in a nearby town. So far I've been away every week-end for the past four months. I've met some very nice people.

There's plenty of work here  -  to last me for the duration.

And the weather is really "something". It's nice and warm  -  not like Neark  -  and even Maplewood!

Please thank the girls who wrote to me  -  Gloria Gasson; Bernice Hill; Gloria Borrow; Kitty Grant; Hazel Quackenbush. I think it was swell of them to write to me. If I had more time I would write to each and everyone individually but I'm really up to my neck in work. I hope to be able to write more often and of course I'm more than happy to hear from N.S.T.C. members.

As Ever,

Eddie
