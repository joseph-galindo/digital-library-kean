Dear Miss Lipson & Miss Thompson

Both the censor and the type of stationary we use do not allow much in our letters. So I'll write this one for both of you.

Your former helper is in England waiting for his assignment to come through. Meanwhile, hardly a thing goes by that I fail to observe regarding our English cousins and their country. I'm having a wonderful time  -  so far.

The war time restrictions at home are insignificant alongside those the English people have to put up with. They don't seem to feel them at all. I supposed this is the reason England still exists and will continue to until peace finally does come.

Please write to me and send the Reflector if possible.

Sincerely,

Sidney
