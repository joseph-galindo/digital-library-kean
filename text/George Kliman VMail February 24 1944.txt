Dear Ira  - 

I went to London last week and was able to meet Sid at the Rainbow Club. It sure was a happy reunion. Sid remarked about my getting stuck and I noticed to myself that dear Sidney is losing his hair running around after London gals. He is really a gigolo! I met his cousin, Rita Kreeger, who is a very charming girl. All three of us dined at the Hotel Picadilly and from there went to an American Square Dance at the Red Cross. It was an enjoyable day  -  and shall I add a memorable one! Life here is pretty good as well as it is with Sid too. He has a office job in the Medical Hq. and is in the pink. That's all the dirt for the present. Regards to the family.

Georgie Porgie
