Dear Miss Thompson  - 

It pleases me to announce another change of address. My A.P.O. is now 637 and I'm at a different air base than before. I thought that my travels would be confined to the states alone, but Uncle Sam has other ideas. I am very well and wish to be remembered with sincerest regards to the faculty  -  in their trials and tribulations. This year should bring good news for our side, I'm sure. My sightseeing has been cut down due to the increase of work. Got to keep `em flying.

George
