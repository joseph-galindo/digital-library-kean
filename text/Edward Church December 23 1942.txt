Dear Dr. Shaffer:

I certainly appreciate your sending me copies of the Service Mens Paper and the Reflector. It was really good to hear what is going on at Newark and also to learn where abouts in the service many of my former classmates were located. I hope that we in the service will be able to keep in touch with each other through the college papers and I'm sure that all of us appreciate your kindness in making this possible.

I was back east on a ten day furlough returning on the nineteenth. I was the proud father of an eight lb baby boy who was born December ninth so in a few years maybe there will be another Eddie Church at Newark State.

Sincerely

Edward R. Church
