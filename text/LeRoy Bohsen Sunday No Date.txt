Dear Miss Thompson,

Just a short note to thank you all at NSCTC for that last copy of "Service Mens News"  -  It is fun knowing how all the old grads are getting along.

For myself, I've been moved out here to the Oklahoma A&M College to study the Japanese language for several months to come  -  It's awfully hard to think that a little `ole Industrial Arts Teacher like myself is soon to speak Japanese  -  Can you picture it?

At any rate, classes begin tomorrow and from what I've been able to learn, its all going to end up in a tremendous amount of study. Wonder if I can make the grade and uphold the tradition of NJTC?

The whole setup here is marvelous  -  one line right in the college dorm with a nice room all to himself  -  the chow is excellent  -  the town of Stillwater is quite nice  -  say didn't Mr. Keezer once have something to do with Stillwater? If he did, I'd sure like to write to him  -  what is his address? How about Wally Clovesaddren(sp?)

Say hello to everyone for me  -  Ok

Sincerely,

Roy
