Yes  -  I'm somewhere's in England again  -  but this time at the smallest American Air Base in the British Isles. Have every modern convenience one could ask for  -  yes, even including a bath tub & tiled showers. Ah, what a beautiful surrounding. Best of everything to the faculty  -  and wishes for your good health.

George
