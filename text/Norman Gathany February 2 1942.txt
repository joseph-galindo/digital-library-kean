COMPANY A, 5[TH] SIGNAL TRAINING BATTALION
SIGNAL CORPS REPLACEMENT TRAINING CENTER
FORT MONMOUTH, RED BANK, N.J.

February 2, 1942

Dear Miss Thompson,

I understand that our college is making a drive to collect books for the use of the various United States armed forces.

As an active member of the Recreation and Moral section at Fort Monmouth, I thought that I might be able to offer a few suggestions pertaining to the type of book that would be useful to many of the soldiers.

Fort Monmouth is a large training school established here to train men in communications. The subjects here are not too different from those taught in college. Of course some of the courses are different because they are more technical.

Books in the following fields will help some of the boys to brush up on subjects that they have not used for years.

Mathematics, Electricity, Physics, Chemistry etc.

Educational books in psychology would fit in very well because a number of the men are made teacher-instructors.

Of course any fiction books that might be offered will certainly help to spend some idle hours for all of the boys. It certainly is fine that we have people at home that will devote their time to making the soldiers feel more comfortable. Please send along my best wishes to all my friends at college.

Very truly yours,

Corporal Norman Gathany
