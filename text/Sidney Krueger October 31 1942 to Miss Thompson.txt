Dear Miss Thompson:

The scrapbook containing letters from service men which you showed me really gave a great deal to look forward to in the Army.

Being a veteran of one month, allow me to confirm all the good things the boys have written about. I for one consider it a privilege to have been given the opportunity of attending a camp such as ours is while learning to defend the most precious things we own at the same time.

Starting Monday, I am going to Clerk's School to be taught Army Medical Administration work. Up to this time we have been through everything from 10 minutes in a gas chamber (using gas masks) to 2 mile hikes pretending gas and air attacks [illegible] incipient. Sometimes I feel I've learned more in these four weeks than I did in the four years I spent at school. I guess the above is a rash statement. Maybe I should add I might not be where I am were it not for college.

You should have the post card I sent you with my Army address. I'd like to be place on the Reflector mailing list for servicemen if there is such a thing.

In conclusion, I do hope you'll take a few moment out of your busy day to say "hello."

Sincerely

Sidney
