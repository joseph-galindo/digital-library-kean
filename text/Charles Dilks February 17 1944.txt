Dear Mr. Hatch:

Just a few lines to let you know that I'm still alive and in the Navy. Have been for about a year. In fact it will be a year tomorrow. My field is Radar: Guess you have heard about rabbits in the hat.

I also became the proud papa of a son last May. 

I hope that everything is going along in fine style with you and yours.

Please give my regard to gang of N.J.S.T.C. & EPIT.

Respectfully,

Charles H. Dilks
Lt.  -  U.S.N.R.
