My dear Nancy: (continued) broken legs & arms who were in pain in favor of other, but such men do not die as quickly as men suffering other types of injuries. It wasn't anybody's fault casu-alties were heavy & the roads were so banged up & we were moving so fast that it became improbable for 3[rd] echelon stuff to keep up with us. Finally, after a 12-hr. wait, at 3 AM our SOS was answered & a string of 10 ambulances came rolling in. With a sigh of relief I gave the men who didn't have a foot his last shot of morphine to relieve the terrible ache in his big toe. ¶ But that all seems long ago & now we are "sweating it out" as Maulden says. Sweating out the Pacific & hoping & praying we get our 30 days in the states instead of going direct. Sweating out possibly 6 months of temporary occupation because of the tightness of the shipping situation  -  at least thats' the latest poop.  ¶ We are very fortunate for we do our sweating in lovely lovely country & "non-frat" is not too rigorously enforced. There is much work to be done & we are kept busy. I have done a lot of mountain climbing, picked up a smattering of German, been shamed into giving a series of orientation lectures  -  ranging from Dumbarton Oaks to things more current , & thus it goes. Bye now. Cheers(sp?)

Harold
