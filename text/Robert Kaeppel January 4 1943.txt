To The Students and Faculty, 
	The Christmas gift arrived a few days before the 25[th] but of course I didn't open it until Xmas.  I was very happy when I opened it because it reminded me of the happy years I spent at N.J.S.T.C.  I want to thank you very much for the gift 
	I hope you all had a merry Christmas season.  Although I had to go to school New Year's Eve  I was off  Christmas day.  The people here in Denver are wonderful to the soldiers.  I received an invitation to spend Xmas day at a private home through the Service club in Denver.  
	As I said we had to go to school on New Year's Da.  This meant that I went to school from 12 midnight until 8a.m. the first day of the year.  I guess I really started the year off right this year. 
	The weather here has been mild as compared to what I thought it would be.  We have been had a few snow falls but the snow didn't last long.  Of course there is snow on the mountains and the winter sports are in full swing.
	My course here at the photography school is very interesting and I am enjoying it very much.
	It is nearly time for me to go to school so I must sign off.

               Sincerely yours,
               Robert Keappel
