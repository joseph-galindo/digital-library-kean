Dear Miss Thompson,

After all these months I think its almost time I break down and let you know `what's cookin'.

As you probably recall, I am a Link Trainer instructor. Almost all my time is taken up teaching Control Tower Operators course. Three days ago we moved from Chanute Field, Illinois to Truox Field, Madison, Wis.

At present we are putting the school together. If nothing radically happens, we will open school Tuesday morning.

It might interest you to know that four miles from our field is the University of Wisconsin. The campus is situated beautifully. The Lake is on one side and the city of Madison on the other. The only thing lacking out here is the women from Jersey.

Bye for now and I promise not to allow this much time between letters again. Give De. Downs my regards.

Ted
