Dear Miss Thompson

At last! A few free minutes to try to catch up on my correspondence I have been too busy to ever write home for the past few weeks.

We are working very hard and having a lot of fun doing it. I enjoy my work very much, and refuse to be deterred in my ambition for wings and a bar  -  even if the course is getting rougher all the time.

We are doing night flying now and I enjoy every minute of it. Each trip provides new thrills and opens new horizens for me.

Several weeks ago I was in L.A. and got a chance to see the Huntington Librabry. Although the best piece were in the vault I did see a wonderful exhibit of printing from Guttenburgs time till now. It was the finest history of printing I have ever seen. Really one that I thoroughly enjoyed. I am sending some pamphlets along in a few days for the library  -  I hope you like them. 

Well I must close now  -  write soon and let me know all the news  -  I really miss your letters.

Love and kisses

Bill Harrell
