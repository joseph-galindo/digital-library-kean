Hello Miss Thompson; 
	I thought it was about time I dropped you aline even if only a short one.  I guess I haven't written since April or May.
	When I was home the past couple of weeks ago I'm sorry I couldn't get down to school more often but you realize I couldn't because of conditions at home.  I thank you for the card and what you said.  Though I lost something I can never replace I did gain a wife as you know now.  We are very happy Miss Thompson and Mildred finishes this year she will be coming down here to spend the summer any here with me.  Even though I am married I do expect to return to school when the war is over.  At present it seems as if we can manage it perfectly.
	You should have seen Bob Salkin's face when I told him I got married.  He was mighty surprised.  At yet I haven't seen Earl Murphy since I've been back.  Rubin has been retained as a instructor and assigned to my squadron.
	This Christmas is a wet one with plenty of rain and rather dull.  Nuts!!  We did though have a marvelous turkey dinner, Uncle Sam really did right by us.  
	I'm still working in the school and enjoying it as much as can be expected.  The school is now cut down to two shifts.  I guess they are finally acquiring enough machanics.  How long I expect to stay here I don't know.  If you heard the presidents speech yesterday saying he expects 5,000,000 of the 10,000,000 men over seas by July 1 you can see we'll probably be moving out soon.  
	When I returned to camp I found a couple of "Service Men's Service News and "Reflections" to read.  Thanks fo the one who is responsible for sending them to us. 
	I guess this is all for now, I'll try to do better at writing this time.
						Good wishes and a Happy New Year to you 
						Howard L.
