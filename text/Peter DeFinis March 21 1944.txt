March 21, 1944

My Dear Miss Thompson,

I promised you I'd write to you as soon as I was stationed somewhere, after finishing my schooling at Fort Mourot. At that time I also promised you a picture of myself. At this sitting I can only send you this letter for I don't have a suitable snapshot of myself handy.

After waiting around for two months they decided to send me here in San Francisco. I have been assigned to the Harbor Defence. But before sending me here they gave me a seven-day delay en-route. 

A very opportune time to get married to the girl I've been engaged to for a long time I thought. Immediately on my arrival home I commenced planning for the event. Marie, my fiance and I were married in New York City on March 4, 1944. 

I am now planning to have her come out here with me as soon as I can find a suitable place to live.

My job here is a simple one. I search the harbor for water-craft. Just how, I cannot tell as yet. That will only be told after the war.

As some soldiers put it, we men in this particular unit have it soft. I must agree for we work eight hour shifts, we don't stand revellie or retreat, we don't stand formations or inspections and to top it, we don't stand any guard duty or pull K.P. What do you think? I know you too think it soft, well your correct.

I'll close now and promise you that I shall have a snapshot for you in my next letter. My best and sincerest to you Miss Thompson, to the faculty of Newark State and to the student body. 

Sincerely, 

Peter DeFinis
