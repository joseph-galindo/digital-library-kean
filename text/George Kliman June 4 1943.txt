								Friday- June 4, - `43


Dear Miss Thompson,

	Greetings from this grand city. I'm saving my free time between Okland and Fresco.

	Of its beautiful sights and scenery you desire to see, I invite you to the grandest state, second to Jersey of course.

							Optimist,

							George






Regards to the faculty and friends...
