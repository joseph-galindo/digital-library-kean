May 16, 1943

Dear Miss Thompson:

At long last I have an address which at present seems rather permanent. The summary of the address will not, however, have any bearing on my actual location. I am now stationed at a post which is completely bound by secrecy and censorship. The best that I can give in the way of information is that I am still on United States soil.

I received a copy of the Servicemens News while I was at Camp Shenango. It certainly was full of news of the lads about whom I have inquired. Please keep this project alive. It fills the gap that exists between us and the old college.

Regards to all.

Sincerely,

Pat
