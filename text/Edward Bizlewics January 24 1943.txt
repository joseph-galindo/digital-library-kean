Dear Miss Thompson,

I want to thank you for the letter of recommendation you sent me. I successfully passed the cadet test, and I'm now awaiting to be sent to a cadet classification center, which will be in the near future. In the meantime I have transferred to another squadron, the address of which you will find at the head of the letter.

I have visited Joe O'Sullivan at Kelly Field, and he certainly was a sight for sore eyes. At the cadet center, he is kept in confinement of his barracks, so we just sat and talked for about four hours; why I just about wore him out with questions about things up in Newark. After he qualifies, he will be shipped to a school.

I received a little leather folder, with pictures of college scenes, for Christmas. It was one of the best gifts that a soldier could receive, and I want you to convey my thanks to the school for it. It came as an absolute surprise, and it really brought back many memories.

We had freezing weather here last week. The temperature went down to 11 degrees above zero. Many cars froze, as well as the soldiers who aren't used to freezing temperatures. It lasted two days, and now its warm once more with the mercury up around the 90 degree mark.

I wonder if you could send me Al Condasco's address? I lost the one he sent me, and I can't to him.

I hear some of the girls are getting marriage conscious at the rate this is going, I doubt if there will be any left by the time the war is won.

That about takes care of everything I have to say for now. Once more, thanks for everything you have done for me, you sure are swell  -  

Very truly yours

Edward
