In not so enchanting New Guinea

Dear Miss Thompson:

The Service Men's News for June/44 and your letter of July 10[th], chock full of inimitable "homey" items, arrived simultaneously a few days ago & needless to say these eyes of mine again received a goodly quota of pleasantries. You must excuse me for the "faux pas" made in one of my previous letters calling the magnolia trees flanking the side entrance of the college of all things  -  "dogwoods". Wonder what Mr. Kezer would have said to that? It'll be a surprise to me if I even recognize a simple Elm when I get back  -  what with living in this maze of coconut palms for over a year. Yes  -  you may call me "coconut happy" or "jungle happy" if you will. A strange malady indeed! Had the novel experience of teaching a course in elementary Chinese not so long ago. Didn't mind teaching things with phonetic  -  but oh  -  those hieroglyphics! What a quaint way of torturing oneself. Between learning Japanese, Malayan, Pidgion English & Chinese I now find myself studying elementary English grammar again. The "zoot suiters" with their "jive" talk  -  would find it rather hard to "dig" me. Sorry to learn about Dr. Shaffer & Miss Kane resigning. They're associated with so many happy memories revolving around my days at the college. Will never forget them. When I read about Mr. Hess' appointment as Deputy Mayor I couldn't help but swell with pride. You know that feeling  -  "I know him personally." Tell Mr. Sloan that I am preparing a rather comprehensive compendium on things peculiar to the "land down under"  -  for one of his classes one day. If he'll have me. Hope to see you soon. Good night and regards to all. Sincerely  -  Charlie
