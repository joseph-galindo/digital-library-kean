Finney Gen. Hosp.

Dear Miss Thompson:-

In accordance with my promise to you when I last saw you, I am writing.

Truthfully, I'm a pretty disgusted soldier. I've been in the hospital again, for the past 2 weeks and don't know when I'm to get out. My knee bothers me continuously and I'm rather ashamed of my service record. I haven't had one chance to date, to make something out of myself, my knee hampering me constantly in every endeavor. As is, I'm disqualified from O.C.S. etc. all due to my injury. Oh well, maybe better days are in sight.

Are there any Newark Staters in the vicinity of Ga. I can write to?

Give my fondest regards to miss Lipson and keep up the fine work.

Vincent DiGiovanni
