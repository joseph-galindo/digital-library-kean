Okinawa
7 Oct 1945

Dear Miss Thompson,

I made a move recently and what a move! Clear across the Pacific. It was a wonderful trip. We flew over 7000 miles and I enjoyed every minute of it. We flew the southern route and had stop overs at Canton Island, Tarawa, Los Negros, (illegible) Peleliu, Lizon and finally arrived on Oki: On Lizon we had a week wait and really saw some of the island. Manila is a wreck through and through. The Japs seemed to take a sadist pleasure in destroying everything of importance, Govt buldings, schools, churches, hospitals are all in ruin. It was/is a shame.

While on Lizon I picked up a monkey which has been named Mike. He is rapidly becoming a spoiled brat. I would like to bring him back with me but I haven't much hope.

Okinawa is quite an island, what a place to have to live. The scenery isn't too bad but the living conditions are terrible and from a health standpoint, there is too much (illegible) and elephantitus for comfort. The Jap tombs are the most interesting thing over here and they are completely off limits to (illegible). They are horse-shoe shaped  -  usually built into a hillside and have very narrow small openings blocked by carved marble or granite stones  -  later cemented over by the U.S. Army to keep us out.

I guess that is about all for now  -  write soon.
