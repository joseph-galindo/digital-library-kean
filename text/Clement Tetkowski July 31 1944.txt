Dear Miss Thompson,

Life on our mountain is life! There's plenty of space, plenty of room for the eyes to relax and roam, plenty of green stuff, and yellow-green stuff, and time (glory!), and best of all someone to share the whole business with. We're learning to live off the "fat of the land." There's our little joke about the food. I call, "Oh peddler was around again." Answer, "What'd he have this time?" "Oh, peaches," or "stringbeans," or "Black raspberries," etc, Our own little garden surprises us. Mostly everything about it was experimentation. And we have discovered fun in berry hunting, especially with danger provided by the villainous neighbor whose land it is.

Clem is on a 24hr-on, 24 hr-off schedule. We like it, expecially since I see him during his rest period in the day on, down on his post. In true Army fashion, I hang out in the P-X, day room, play ping pong, pool, write on USO stationary, and hope for a 3-day pass.

We just got a 2-day pass. It starts next week  -  (end next week too). We expect to spend it in New England, all of which I have never seen.

I've written to Poughkeepsie about teaching. They requested recommendations on teaching experience and college record. Could you please send me that about me which you could harmlessly write?

Clem is fine, of course. We both enjoy Serviceman's News. He meant to write but his old responsibilities plus his new ones don't leave him much time for letter-writing. Guess I got that duty along with the loving and honoring.

We'd like very much to hear from you.

Sincerely, Lenore
