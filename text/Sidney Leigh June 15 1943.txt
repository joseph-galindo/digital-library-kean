Dear Miss Thompson  -  

Once again you may move the pin! This time it travels across to "Somewhere in England!" Not too definite  -  however England itself isn't too large a place so you shouldn't be more than 100 miles wrong wherever you place the pin. But wherever you place that pin you'll probably place it in surroundings about as lovely as mine  -  I'm billeted in a small village, typically English consisting of a church, pub and a few small farms. it's about a miles off the main highway, just a few miles from my airhome(?)  -  and in the evening I go out to walk in the fields  -  or sit in the pub and sip ale with the local gentlemen  -  or perhaps toss pebbles into a small pond nearby in which about five ducks are swimming. Rather a peaceful life  -  (!!!). Of course I do work occasionally too. Incidentally I'm known about the college as an alumnus  -  tell me, does this infer that I was graduated? One of the freshmen complained bitterly at not finding my likeness in a yearbook!!!!

Sincerest regards,

Sid Leigh
