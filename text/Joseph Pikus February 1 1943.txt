Dear Miss Nancy T,
	I received a card from the Esquire people in this afternoon's mail telling me about your generosity you must know, Miss Thompson, that your kindness and th [illegible; myltfulness?], th [illegible; foet?] that you remember me works wonders with my spirits. I am and will ever be grateful to you for your many favors and how they have helped me. 
	There is very little time to write. Our spare time I now taken up with compulsory supervised study, "you can lead a [illegible] to water but you can't make [illegible; helm?] drunk". I would like to show this to th Director, but I know I would be out of th school before I finished half of th epigram.
	So far so good.  In my academic work, my grades don't make me [illegible; ant?] a Rhodes Scholar [illegible; nor?] am I slated for [illegible; Motgmony?] [illegible; Stut?] School. I have about a B+ average. I have passed my Saturday inspections and I'm enjoying th soldering much more than th academics. 
	It's difficult to believe that I am half through this course. Our [illegible] [illegible] Calendar says 44 more days to go or about six weeks. We have [illegible; waded?] through weapons, [illegible; mago?] [illegible; wading?], military correspondence, War Department Filing, mess management, and other miscellaneous subjects which I can't recall. We are now studying Courts and Boards and classification.   Two more weeks of this, then th general exam and then we enter our breakdown; in my case classification.
	I don't know whether or not I told you about Dr. Dal visiting at Fort Eustis a day or two before. I left for school, he wrote, in his capacity of Secretory Expert Consultant to th Secretary of War, a very [illegible; nice?] letter about over work which at this point I miss.
 As ever,
Joe
