My Dear Miss Thompson,

It has been quite some time since I've had the opportunity to write. I shall endevour to bring you as up to date as possible.

Things are pretty much the same here. The same grind day in and day out. I'm still operating Radar. My off duty hours are spent working part-time in a local shipyard, working as a radio technician. I'm installing radio receivers, transmitters and Radar on Navy tankers.

I spent my last furlough touring this beautiful country with my wife. We visited the Monterey Bay, Carmel, the Kedwoods, Los Angeles etc. I also spent a few day in New Mexico visiting my brother who is in the Air Corps stationed at Fort Sumner. We had quite a lot of fun looking over our beautiful country. We hope for the day when we can tour it without a time limit.

In closing, my best and sincerest wishes to you Miss Thompson, to the faculty and to the student body of N.J.S.T.C.

Sincerely,

Peter De Finis
Clas of 1943
