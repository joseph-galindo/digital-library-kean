Dear Miss Thompson,

	Your very nice birthday greeting card, which you mailed on March 2, arrived on April 22. It traveled to Texas, North Carolina, Indiana, New York and finally got here a little late, but ever so welcome. I know my old sweetheart wouldn't forget me  -  and if I knew your birthday I'd even send you one  -  what do you thing of that? Nerveless, thanx a million  -  it was very nice of you to remember me.

	If you should ever find the time (and kidding) I'd really like to hear from you. My time is my own at this place. Best wishes and best regard to you at Newark State. I really miss you all. 					Most sincerely,
								Bill Peterson
