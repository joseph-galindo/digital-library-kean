Dear Mr. Singer


	I am stationed her at Miami Beach. 

Yes- I am a full fledged member of the air corp and an now training as a radio operator and mechanic. I know it is a far cry from teaching, but I am glad in the knowledge that I am helping to do my part in aiding our country to win this war.

	Fortune is with me as I am in one of the finest branches of service. The army life is a clean and healthy one, and don't let anybody tell you different. Personally, I like it [illegible- need to look at the original and see if it is just bc of the copier]. I am learning what true discipline, obedience and cooperative responsibility is- -

	My job is to check on airplane radios to see that they are in working order and if I fail to do my job, I hold the fate of between 5-9 men in each plane.

	Please give my regards to Miss Balling, and when we have won victory, I shall return to the teaching field that I enjoy so much. I would appreciate you giving the faculty my sincerest regards for a good year. I think of you and them often. "Keep `em flying"
