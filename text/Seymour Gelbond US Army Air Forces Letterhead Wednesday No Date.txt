U.S. ARMY AIR FORCES

Wednesday

Dear Nancy  - 

You and I have have finally hit an impasse. If I remember correctly, you owe me at least two letters, the last from way back at Miami Beach. If you recall I asked, "Write me, will ya?" Have you done so?

Since we have always been good chums even back in those never to be forgotten civilian days, I had hoped that you'd care to write. However I suppose that I'm to remain another pin point in the "Men in Service" map. So for the records, here I am at George Peabody College, Nashville, Tennesee.

Expect to remain here for one more month of cadet training, flying Aeronca Cubs. After that, my fate is in the proverbial lap. I'm having a fine time however. The life is interesting and the women resonsive. As you know this is one of the finest teachers' colleges in the south. Quite a few Kadelpians around and I've been invited to all their meetings etc.

How long my peculiar non beligerant status will continue, I do not know. It's about time I were going overseas. Almost 2 (1/2) years now and the Army persists in educating me. To sum up my educational sojourns in the Army, they have been
  1. Missouri Aviation Institute
  2. Penn State
  3. Geo. Peabody College
Lest we forget may I also include Fort Dix, Jefferson Barracks, West Point, CCNY, New Cumberland and Miami Beach. Really getting around.
How are you doing and what's new at NSTC?
I still wish you'd write  -  
As ever  -
