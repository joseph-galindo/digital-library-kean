Dear Dr. Powers,
	Graduation day is over and I haven't had a chance to relax since.  I do not know whether it is my luck or my misfortune that I have been made an instructor at Chanute Field.  But one thing I do know, I shall be here for some time instructing other men in Link Trainer.
	To give you an idea of how fast things work in the Army, our informal graduation lasted twenty minutes.  Immediately following the exercises I was ordered to report at school five hours later ready to start teaching a new class.  
	Well, if you ever saw a chicken with its head cut off, that's what I looked like.  Running to and fro, gathering notes here and there, and finally completing my lesson plan a few minutes before the start of class.
	Do not ask me as yet whether I like to teach or not.  I do not know.  I haven't been able to sit down long enough to answer my own foolish questions.
	Time flies on and so must I.  Give my regards to all the boys and tell them to study hard.  It pays off in large dividends.
Ted
