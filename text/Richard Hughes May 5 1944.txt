Dear Miss Thompson,

	First of all, I want to offer my sincerest apologies for not writing sooner. However, you must have some sort of conception of this Navy where you can't call one minute your own. 
	Needless to say, quite a bit of water has passed under the keel since the last time I wrote. Experiences, both horrible and amusing, have occurred which I shall never forget. In view of the new censorship regulations I am permitted to tell you that I have been in on the landings at Ormoc Bay, Lingayen Gulf and Nasugbu on Luzon, Palawan and Cebu. From here on, however, you will have to draw your own conclusions.
	I hear that quite a few of the fellows are now on duty out this way. As yet I haven't run into any of them but am always on the lookout. I would appreciate it very much if you could send a few of their addresses, especially the ones in the Navy, which would make my task of locating them a comparatively simple one.
	From last reports, the class of '46 was anxiously looking forward to the time when they would go out on the their first practicum. It hardly seems possible that they are all now juniors and are on the final road to being a full fledged teacher. I empus fugit!
	As the present prospects of getting home in the near future aren't too good. It is my personal belief, however, that with a little luck and a few prayers we ought to see the U.S.A. around the first of the year. You can rest assured that I will pay you all a visit "when and if", 

								Until then  -  
								Sincerely
								Dick Hughes
