Dear Miss Thompson:

Thank you for the kind thought at Christmas time. It certainly makes a fellow feel swell to know that his school friends haven't forgotten him. I know that goes for boys all over the world who have received cards from you and the school.

Since I was home last or wrote last my address here has changed. I know that you want to use the latest address so here it is.

Cpl. Sanford Gottlieb 12080209
Sq. D. 315[th] AAF Base Unit
Branch #2 Box #1742
Drew Field, Florida

The other day I received the Service Men's News and was very happy to hear that Charles DePace is back in the states. I was still in school when he left. He certainly deserves to be back. I would sure like to see him. We were practically inseparable for four years, that also includes Ed Gildner and Frank Defino. I know where Ed is, but I don't know where Frank is.

A few weeks ago I had quite a pleasant surprise. I walked into a restaurant on a Sunday night and as I was walking to the table, I saw three wac officers sitting at a table. One looked very familiar, yet I couldn't place her until I came up to her table. Of all people to meet in Florida, Ellen Weaver. She was on a week-end pass in Tampa from Tallahassee. I believe Ellen was the first person from N.S.T.C. that I've met while in the Army. It was a very pleasant surprise, I must say again.

 I am still holding the fort here at Drew Field. I've been here almost 21 months now and have had only two jobs. It seems odd, some fellows move around from camp to camp and job to job, and I move very little. I just can't figure it out. I am working in a Squadron Supply Room. It is my jobs to see that the men's needs are taken care of, from their clothing to their living quarters. All in all I am kept busy and time goes quickly. I really have nothing to complain about, compared to others in the service.

I guess that is all I have for now. Send my regards to your colleagues.

Sincerely

Sanford
