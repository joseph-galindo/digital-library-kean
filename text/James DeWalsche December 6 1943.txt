State Teacher's College
Newark, New Jersey

Dear Mr. Hatch;

During the past year I have been engaged in teaching propeller overhaul and also carrying on a teacher-training program as a Chief Petty Officer in the U.S. Naval Reserve.

However, I now have the opportunity of advancement to the status of a commissioned officer. This ordinarily necessitates letters of recommendation. Therefore I am asking you to see what your files will bring forth for me.

In cases of this kind it is the usual practice for the applicant to collect his data and he in turn to forward it to the examining board. For this reason I am asking that you send the recommendation to my home address which for the present is the above. 

I do hope all is well with you and also that your problem of securing industrial arts teachers has eased a bit by now.

Sincerely yours,

James DeWalsche
