Hello Miss Thompson,

I was very glad to hear from you. I had always meant to let you and the school know where I was and what I was doing but for the first seven months of my Army career I was unassigned and unattached due to my peculiar brand of luck.

However, now I can tell you what I am doing and really enjoy telling the tale. I started in the Infantry, was transferred to the Adjutant Generals, then to the Quartermaster and have finally wound up in the Medical Corps. 

I am the psychologist at the Station Hospital in the Neuro-psychiatric clinic. I am engaged in the most fascinating work of my career. It amounts to an internship in a mental hospital and I am working under a very able psychiatrist. I do the psychometrics and the social case histories of these patients and the stories are a wonderful education in abnormal behavior. As you know I was working on my Master's Degree in Psychology at Rutgers when I was inducted and I find my training is really useful in the Army. Miss Baldwin will probably be surprised to know what I am up to these days.

Please convey my regards to my friends on the faculty.

Very truly yours

Phil Goldberg
