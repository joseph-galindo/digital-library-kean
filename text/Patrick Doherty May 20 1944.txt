20  -  May  -  1944

DEAR MISS THOMPSON,

I have neglected you all too long so old man conscience has given me the prod to take my pen in hand. So here goes.

Life for me remains quite the same. Each month brings its share of traffic accidents to be investigated, wrecked equipment certificated, statements of charge drawn up, Reports of Survey made and the inevitable Saturday inspection. In addition to my other duties, I, as special Service Officer am operating a movie projector six nights a week. Occasionally, my job affords a junket around North Africa and over to Italy. I have seen Naples but I am not ready to die. To me it resembles something that outgrew last year's clothes. The houses are packed together more closely than anything I have ever seen. This is attested by many of the newsreel shots which showed the occupation of the city by the Allies.

I have also seen the horrible handiworks of Mt. Vesuvius' latest escapade. It seemed unbelievable to look out and see buildings and roads half swallowed by a wall of lava.

We had our first coffees two weeks ago. This week I ate my first fresh grapefruit and apple in over a year.

Regards to all

Pat
