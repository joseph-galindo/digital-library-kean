                      EVERYBODY WAS NOBLE AND I HAD FUN!
                                       
	I am sitting here trying to remember how it all started! I haven't the faintest recollection of discussing the project with anyone. All I can recall is Dr. Shaffer giving me an equivocal send-off, cautioning me not to be too disappointed if none of the boys answered us: that the idea was a good one, anyway. Later on, he told me that it had turned out surprisingly well and that there was nothing at all like it. I never had any doubts about it that I can remember. It was a chance to talk to the boys as we used to in the library and I welcomed it.
	The re-reading of my copies of the Service Men's News gave me this one reaction -- those of us who knew the men well all feel it -- the varied responses of these men to their experience all had one thing in common -- love for their country, and pride in it.
	I wish we could know what has happened to them all since. It would be more interesting than any book I have read on this subject.
	My final thought as I go through my "News" copies is of the very fine cooperation of the faculty and the graduates in giving me copy, and one thought stands out, "Everybody was noble and I had fun!"
