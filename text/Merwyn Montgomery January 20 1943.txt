DEAR MISS THOMSON,

I HOPE THAT YOU WILL EXCUSE ME FOR NOT WRITING SOONER. NOW THAT I HAVE STARTED RADIO SCHOOL, MY TIME IS NOT MY OWN. YOU WILL ALSO HAVE TO EXCUSE THE CONDITION OF THE TYPING.
NO DOUBT YOU HAVE NOTICED THIS TYPE IS SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT THAN THAT OF MOST OTHER TYPEWRITERS.
THE REASON FOR THIS IS THAT I AM USING A NAVY RADIOMANS TYPEWRITER,

PRIMARILY, I SHOULD LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR THOUGHTFUL LETTER AND GIFT. I'M SURE THAT ALL MY FORMER CLASS- MATES WHO ARE NOW IN THE ARMED FORCES APPRECIATE YOUR THOUGHTFULNESS AS MUCH AS I DO.

YOU WILL NOTICE MY ADDRESS AT THE TOP OF THIS PAGE. THE R-30 IS MY PLATOON NUMBER. MY RANK IS THAT OF SEAMAN/2[ND] CLASS.

MY SCHOOL SCHEDULE FOR THE DAY IS AS FOLLOWS:
RADIO THEORY. . . . . 3 HOURS
RADIO CODE. . . . . . . . 3 HOURS
SEAMANSHIP . . . . . . . 2 HOURS


MY LIBERTIES ARE FROM SATURDAY NOON UNTIL MONDAY MORNING, SO I WON'T BE ABLE TO DROP AROUND TO SEE YOU FOR SOME TIME TO COME.

I SEE MANNY COHN QUITE OFTEN, AND HE TELLS ME THAT HE WILL BE LEAVING SHORTLY.

UNTIL I SEE/ OR HEAR FROM YOU, I REMAIN
		
				SINCERELY,
         MERWYN MONTGOMERY
