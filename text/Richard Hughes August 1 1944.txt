Dear Miss Thompson,

	No doubt I have owed you this letter for quite some time. I received a copy of the "Servicemen News" and in spite of being quite busy I thought I would take time out to show my appreciation for the many copies I have already received. It is almost as good as a letter from home.
	As for me I have been living a very varying life after leaving the states some ten months ago. At times the going has been rather tough but I always figure that there are fellows a little worse off than I am/ I have seen a considerable amount of action in this theatre of the war. Our engagements against the enemy have been from the air and shore batteries.
	Of course there is always the brighter side to life aboard a destroyer. In the early part of the year we spent a ten day recreation period in Australia. The times I had there sure will be hard to forget. I have a great yearning to go back again after this war is over. 
	At the present time we are in a port quite distant from the immediate battle area. During my stay here I have had the chance to go swimming at one of the most famous beaches in the world. It sure is a beautiful place.
	As I said before my work aboard ship has been keeping me quite busy so I had better bring this epistle to an end. 
	My best regards to the teachers and my friends at Newark State.
		
							Sincerely
							Dick Hughes `46
