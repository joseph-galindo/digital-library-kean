Dear Mr. Sloan:

Seasons greetings and many thanks to you for your thoughtfulness.

My first Army Christmas was a never-to-be forgotten one, what with so much kindness from friends, relatives, civilian organization, and the Army itself. We boys are being highly commended for our sacrifices and efforts. I personally feel this would not be possible without such splendid and generous organizations as the U.S.O. and Red Cross plus numerous others. They try to eradicate all traces of the Army routine when we are in their midst. They have been 100% successful.

At present I am being put through rigorous paces here in Atlantic City. Rumor and fact has it we soon will see the European theatre of operations. I can hardly wait.

In Arkansas I attended Clerk School for 5 weeks and will be able to work in any company or hospital office. Because of my transfer, I didn't receive the Corporal technician rating that goes with completing the course.

The Reflector comes to me regularly and I read it with the pleasure only an alumnus can derive from scanning his Alma Mater's newspaper. I also received a very beautiful, leather photo album with campus photos in it from N.S.T.C. and was very grateful.

If by any chance you do know Seymour Gelbond's address, will you kindly forward it to me?

Again my sincerest wishes for a Happy New Year to you.

Sincerely,

Sidney


P.S. I did see share-croppers but they may be classified as wealthy people along side of the Puerto Rican peon I observed for 10 months last year.
