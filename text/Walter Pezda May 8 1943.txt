Dear Nancy, 

   I'm still down here at the hotel front. Life is more or less routine now. However, I've had some delectable adventures.
   The other day we had a [illegible] poisoning epidemic. Thirty soldiers were taken in ambulances from our hotel. However, my stomach seems to be conditioned to army chow + I didn't fall victim.
   I received the latest "service mens news" + thanks loads. 
   I've heard that Mr. Kaiser, new librarian of NPL, has created a good impression + is already being liked. Especially, since he lets leads have final judgments in matters of departmental policies. This is quite a victory for him because when I left the staff was quite prejudiced against any new lead. We certainly needed new blood. 
   I've also heard that Miss Manley + and Miss [illegible] are applying for ass't lib. vacancy. I hope Manley doesn't get it because the "personal equation" would be too great a factor in her judgments. An outsider would be best.
   The weather down here is getting very much warmer, + at times uncomfortably so. However, the ocean breeze is a great help. 
   We are expecting 800 odd WAACS to come to the Beach in June sometime, so, perhaps I shall be transferred to some unknown destination in near future.
   Guess that's all for now. Chow call has just been sounded. 
   Give my regards to all that still remember me.
   Please write again when you have a few spare minutes sometime. 
   
                                                                     As ever, 
                                                                        Walter
