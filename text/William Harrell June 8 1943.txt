Dear Thompson,

	Well here we are! why I don't know but I can imagine  -  
	I hope you received my post card and was able to read  -  I ceatinly wrote it in a hurry. We are still hoping to get back for the "G" day but are begining to worry a bit, since we have received no word from the college as yet as to the letter Dr. Schaffer was going to write  -  did he or didn't he?
	The pocket book you have me has been donated to our A + R Room here at our hotel (A + R means Athletics and Recreation), but not until all my roommates had finished it. Save a couple for us if we get home for graduation  -  that is if if there are any left.
	Would you let me know how everybody is  -  including "that woman" from the Clay Shop and her map or is it your map now? How's it look? Remember we promised to send a picture of it to Fortune Magazine when it was finished, maybe they will publish it.
	The fellows did not appreciate the postcards that the Senior Cass sent out asking us if we would be able to attend the Senior Breakfast  -  while we are worrying about getting home for graduation! It seemed so idiotic! 
	Tell everybody I will try to write as soon as possible but it really is quite a job, this being a "jeep" in the Army.

                                                                    Sincerely,
                                                                         Bill	
                                                                        Harrel
                                                                             	
P.S. If you ever want to send any of the fellows a small gift  -  the stickers (see envelope) are wonderful!
    B.
