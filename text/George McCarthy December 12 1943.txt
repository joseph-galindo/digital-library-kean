	Dear Miss Thompson,
	I thought I would drop you a line and let you know how things are going with me.
	I was classified as a pilot at Nashville Army Air Center. Im now attending Pre  -  Flight Training at Maxwell Field Ala. The courses' here are plenty rugged, but I think I have a good chance of coming through with flying colors.
	The Service Mens News the school puts out is really swell. The news of the boys in different parts of the country and over seas proves very interesting, In as much it is very hard for us in the service to keep in contact with each other.
	I also want to thank who ever is responsible for the swell Christmas Card I received from the school.
                                      2.
	Some evenings when Im sitting at my desk studying for next days classes, I after say to myself, "this is the way you should have studied when you were going to S.T.C, instead of going out and having a good time." Let me tell you, when and if I ever return to school you will see a changed man.
	That's about all for now, as I must get ready for my Sunday dinner.
                           					Keep `Em Flying,
