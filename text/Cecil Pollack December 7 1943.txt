Dear Miss Thompson, 

	Well it seems everytime I move I get around to writing you, but I never seem to get a letter for you. However, I do realize you are quite busy.
	Uncle Sam has decided that it's about time our outfit did something to earn its pay. After 3 months in Florida he decided to send us to Ft. Jackson, South Carolina. 
	After a fairly good 24 hour trip from Ft. Pierce, we arrived at our new home. We managed to sleep most of the way so we didn't see much of the countryside. That didn't bother us though, for there is not very much to see in Florida + Georgia. 
	We are located in a far off part of the camp for about 8 weeks of final training. After the 8 weeks we expect to head north + then take a boat ride somewhere. 
	There is quite a large presence of our camp two blocks away from us. 
	How are things getting along backat college? 
	I have my fingers crossed for a [illegible] sometime in January. If I do get it, I'll make it my business to spend a day or two at the college. I haven't received a Reflector yet so I'm wondering if they ceased publishing it for the duration. Have they? 
	My new address is 
	Pfc Cecil Pollack 12134597
	2[nd] plt. 3[rd] sq. 
	CoC- 1259 Eng. Ba
	Ft. Jackson South Carolina
Give my regards to all the girls + the faculty. 
	Write if and when you can

	Cecil
