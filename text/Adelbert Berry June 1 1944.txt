North Africa
June 1, 1944

My Dear Miss Thompson,

Your beautiful card wishing me a pleasant birthday arrived today, and all the manners and memories of past natal days rushed into my tears to fill my cup to overflowing.

I am very pleased as the thoughts of a steady correspondence with you and the other members of the faculty. I would like to have as many addresses of faculty members as you can "dig up." I know you will send the students addresses to me, so I won't ask for them this time. (<- Humor)

The "Service Men's News" for April was one of the things I looked forward to when I was in Huachuca. In North Africa I find that It is the link that makes my chain of reality complete. If that did not reach me I would have nothing to assure me that my letters to you people were not being sent to imaginary creatures of another planet. This particular issue had just what I wanted to find out. 

This country over here is amazing in its variety of peoples and climate. Women are to be seen on the streets, draped in sheets and just enough room to peep out with one eye. The men wear baggy trousers of varied hues, or long burmooses(sp?). Turbans are the rage in male headgear. Little burros are the beasts of burden and transportation. It is humorous and tragic to see these tiny creatures struggling under immense loads that hide them completely.

I will be able to rival Erny Shawcross by the time I get back to the United States. He is a member of the "Short Smarters" club, and when I finish dashing around the world I expect to be a well seated member.

Most of us over here are just as anxious as you people back home to get the "Invasion" started, but we know just what that will mean. Only a "fighting man" knows what the "enemy" is like, and he will tell you readily that the "battle is the payoff." I am anxious to be in the "thick of things," and my wishes are being fulfilled. I ask your prayers.
