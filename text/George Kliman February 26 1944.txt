Dear Miss Thompson  - 

I thought you'd like to know that Sid Krueger and I met in London last week. It was without doubt one of the swellest reunions that I've had in England. Side is fine, and is certainly a "man about town" in London, and in the surrounding neighborhoods. He has introduced me to his charming English cousin, who has extended an equal hospitable home to me on my next leave. Everything here is fine, and I am now working "studiously." (if it is permissible to use that term.) Give my sincerest regards to the faculty.

Geographical George
