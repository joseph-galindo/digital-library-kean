DEAR MISS THOMPSON:

THIS IS A SHORT NOTE TO LET YOU KNOW THAT I'M STILL ALIVE AND THINKING OF MY ALMA MATER. WE HAVE BEEN UNUSUALLY BUSY IN THE PACIFIC OF LATE AND TIME IS A VALUABLE THING TO US ABOARD SHIP. IN MY TRAVELS I'VE MET WITH ERNIE SHAWCROSS, BOB BEHRENDY, AND TOM BAZELY, EACH OF THEM IN A DIFFERENT PACIFIC COAST CITY. ERNIE AND I TOOK IN A DAY OF SAN FRANCISCO WHILE I WAS STATIONED ON TREASURE ISLAND, AND BOB BEHRENDT MET ME IN SAN DIEGO DURING MY SHAKEDOWN PERIOD. I HAVEN'T EITHER OF THEIR SERVICE ADDRESSES AND WOULD APPRECIATE YOUR SENDING ME ANY INFORMATION YOU MIGHT HAVE CONCERNING THEM. BAZELY SAID THAT HE'S AN LST SAILOR BUT COULDN'T ELABORATE ANY FURTHER BECAUSE HIS SHIPMATES WERE WAITING FOR HIM AND WENT ON HIS WAY. SEEING YOUR COLLEGE BEOTHERS AGAIN AFTER A YEAR'S ABSENCE TAKES ONE BACK TO THAT FAMILIAR SITE WHERE "A'S" WERE ONE'S GOAL AND PREPARATION WAS SUCH AN UNDERTAKING. AFTER GOING TO NAVAL SCHOOLS FOR OVER A YEAR WHERE THE SCHOOL DAY LAST FROM 0700 TO 2230 AND CLASSES ARE AS LONG AS 3 AND 4 HOURS IN SUBJECTS ONE CAN HARDLY COMPREHEND, I'LL TAKE COLLEGE. I FIND RADAR AND COMMUNICATIONS MUCH EASIER TO WORK WITH AND UNDERSTAND IN THEIR PRACTICAL APPLICATION THAN TRYING TO LEARN THEM IN SCHOOLS ------- AND I MIGHT ADD THAT ONE MAXIM OF IND. ARTS (CROSSED OUT  -  CENSORED?), "COORDINATION OF THE MIND AND THE HAND IS AN EFFECTIVE CORRELATION. (CROSSED OUT  -  CENSORED?) I'LL WRITE AGAIN.
                                                                    A.L. SCOTT
