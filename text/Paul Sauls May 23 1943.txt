Hello Miss Thompson  -  
	Well here we are  -  or at least eighteen or so of the fellows from good old N.S.T.C . and we are quite proud to be here in the Air Force.  We are about to start some tough basic training including commando tactics, obstacle course, calisthenics, machine gun, rifle, bayonet and gas mask training.  Tell Mr. Dan that the calisthenics here will be three hours and two hours daily instead of less than an hour which we heartily enjoyed with him.  As yet, though, we are confined to our hotel  -

(for a week) 	We are at the ambassador right on the boardwalk overlooking the ocean.  The view is quite impressive and the air is wonderful.  We are in a fine, tough, outfit with a good reputation which we must uphold so we have a task ahead of us which we are all looking forward to.  I believe we will really enjoy every day of it, as it is all so new and every day so different.  We expect to be here about two months before we will be sent to Technical Schools all over the country.  
	Give my regards to the faculty  -  write, and tell the girls to also  -  
					as ever,
						Pvt. Sauls
