Dear Miss Thompson 

	Thank you very much for the card.  It's good  to hear from the school once in a while.  I hear quite regularly from some of the students but at present they are away for the summer and there isn't much school news.  I only wish I was returning this fall.  As things are now I won't be so far removed from school though I'll be attending in a different capacity.  I finished the Mechanic's course here on July 16 and was retained as an instructor in "Single Engine Installations."  This past Monday I started instructing.  This is only a temporary arrangement until we go to Chanute Field, Ill. For a 40 days teaching methods course.  On completion we'll return here and commense instructing.  
	I feel it will be an excellent experience for me especially if I'm able to return to school after this mess is over with.  
	I would appreciate it Miss Thompson if you could tell me if is possible to obtain correspondense courses from which men in the service could obtain college credit.  Do you know any colleges that offer such courses?  Since I'm permenant party here now I would have sufficient spare time to study and get ahead.  
	Well, I suppose the male element will be growing smaller as time goes on.  I hope some of the fellows are fortunate enough to make some of those reserve officers commissions.  I wish those had been deep offered when I was there.
Oh, yes, my address has been changed, notice the envelope.  
	All I can say about the South, that it is sure hot and sunny!!!
	Were only 75 miles from New Orleans so we manage to have swell times on the weekends.  I sure would like a furlough but that seems rather far in the future.
	Well, thanks again Miss Thompson and say hello to the teachers for me.  
               Howard L.
