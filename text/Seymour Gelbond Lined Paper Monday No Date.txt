Monday

Dear Nancy  -  

Very nice hearing from you this time. Thought you had definitely given up on me. Don't quite blame you at all, if you had done so. I'm very definitely a "black sheep".

Life is very interesting now. I'm flying Aerouca's 3 times a week now. Very sweet little ship. Steady and responsive at the controls. The air's my element  -  I'm convinced of it. I know of very few things I get as much kick out of the air for me. Should I emerge from this war in any kind of condition, it looks as if I shall combine teaching and aviation when it comes to a career.

Expect to graduate from Peabody in a few weeks and will most likely wind up at Maxwell Field  -  Alabama to take my navigation pre-flight. Looking forward to it. The sooner the better.

Haven't had much time to investigate the library set up here. The Army feels it necessary that I confine my investigations solely to the military or aeronautical field. 

What's new at the old homestead? `Twould be nice hearing from you again despite the brevity (crossed out word and then "sorry very little brain left") of this letter and the apparent scrawl  -  

Sincerely,

Seymour
