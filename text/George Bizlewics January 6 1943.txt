Greetings,

May I extend best wishes for a Happy and Victorious New Year to the faculty and student body of Newark State Teachers College. You have helped make my Holiday a most pleasant one.

Sincere thanks and appreciation are in order to whomever is responsible for the handsome gift, the service newspaper, and the "Reflector" which I have received in the past few weeks. You can't imagine how pleased I was to be remembered by my dear old Alma Mater. Vivid memories played through my thoughts of happy school days, of old friends and teachers, as I read through each line of school news. It hardly seems possible that so much has changed since then. The wallet size picture album of school activities, was especially the keenest thing that I have ever seen. I treasure it among my personal possessions. The Service newspaper has already furnished me up to date material on former classmates who had been transferred to places unknown. I'm looking forward to the next issue, and more news of former friends of N.S.T.C.

Many thanks again for your thoughtfulness.

Sincerely,

Pvt. Geo. J. Bizlewicz
