Dear Aunt Nancy,

You have no idea how glad & surprised I was to receive your letter I had assumed that you were on vacation & had not received our wedding invitation on time to attend so have no fears as to my opinion of your interest in our wedding.

True, our married existence was shortlived but, we decided to go through with it fully cognizant of the fact that I was to be inducted.

Out of our original number, of those who came to camp on the same day with me, about 150, only 3 of us are still here. This leads me to believe, wishful thinking, that something special is in store for me.

I'm told I have the makings of a good soldier, by the older boys, since I have already been A.W.O.L. & apparently that is a main requisite of a good soldier. Don't worry I won't be court-martialed, I still have a slick tongue.

Virginia & I had planned to have you & Miss Seazer, the only other member of our dearly beloved Alma Mater, whom we deemed a pleasure to have with us, & who by the way was able attend, come up to have a cocktail or two with us as soon as the weather cooled off. This we shall have to defer to another time more convenient to the U.S. Army & the powers that be.

I have made application for officer training & hope to be accepted soon or shortly after my basic training at a permanent camp. 

In connection with this, I mailed a card given to me by the Army to the school office. It is a means of checking my school record. If you could check to see if the card was received and the proper answer made, I would be greatly indebted to you. If possible please also see that the card is forwarded to Rutgers University for further confirmation of my work as indicated on the card.

Write again when most convenient & tell me of the results of the above request as well as any of that juicy gossip which almost continually pervades the honorable halls of the institution.

Sincerely,

Uldric
