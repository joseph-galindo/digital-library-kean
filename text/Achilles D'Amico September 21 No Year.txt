UNITED STATES ARMY

Sept 21
France

Dear Miss Thompson:

Just got Servicemen's News and it took exactly from July 21 to reach me- why? Oh no  -  not the Postal Service but some cute embrionic school teacher to be, addressed me as APO #163. They, or rather she, used my APO number as my unit (removed by censor, looks like other side was the intended cut) an the APO. They finally got it straight because they located me through the Officers' location cards. New address for you. APO is now 403. I am not in England as the bulletin says, but very much in France. Been throughout the Normandy Campaign and have travelled a great deal since that time. Have put bridges both across the (redacted) and the (redacted) Rivers. Incidently, my bridge was just across the (redacted)! When I say mine, I actually mean my Battalion's. We also took part in liberating some fairly strategic places. Can't write more due to shortage of stationary.

Were you named after a (redacted)? You should see the place, really pretty  -  especially before the war.

Regards to all  - 

Bad boy  -  Al

P.S.  -  I don't have any cute administrative job either. Just a bunch of sour pusses and me  -
