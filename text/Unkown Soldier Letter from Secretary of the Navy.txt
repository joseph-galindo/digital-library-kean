                          THE SECRETARY OF THE NAVY
                                  WASHINGTON
                                       
	The President of the United States takes pleasure in presenting the Presidential Unit Citation to the
LCI (G) GROUP EIGHT INCLUDING THIE FLAGSHIP OF THE LCI FLOTILLA THREE
    for service as set forth in the following
	CITATION:
		"For extraordinary heroism during action in support of beach reconnaissance by Underwater Demolition Teams at enemy Japanese-held Iwo Jima, Volcano Islands, on February 17, 1945. Opening heavy strafing fire as they moved in from two thousand yards off shore, the lightly armored ships of LCI (G) GROUP EIGHT advanced steadily under sporadic fire of the enemy until they reached the one thousand yard line to blast they heavy coastal defenses with barrage rockets. Almost immediately the shattering counter-fire from well concealed and strongly fortified Japanese positions began to exact a terrific toll. One by one, their guns were silenced; fires started and spread in ready ammunition; under the sustained deadly blast of hostile fire, their engineer rooms flooded and those of the gallant ships still operable towed their powerless companion ships clear of the overpowering fire of the enemy. Suffering desperate casualties, the units of this valiant group evacuated the wounded, extinguished their fires and resolutely returned to the firing line. Only when the beach reconnaissance had been accomplished did LCI (G) GROUP EIGHT retire after absorbing an hour and quarter of devastating punishment in support of the stout-hearted swimmers of the Demolition Team. Manned by fighting and skilled seamen, these gunboats daringly pitted their fire-power against the overwhelming might of Japanese guns zeroed on them from the shores of Iwo Jima and bravely led the way for the invasion two days later."

                                                            For the President,
                                                           /s/ JAMES FORRESTAL
                                                        	Secretary of the Navy
