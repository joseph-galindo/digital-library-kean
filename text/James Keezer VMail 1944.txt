Hey, Nance, the former mouse raiser of the college, lately turned bug chaser for the U.S.A, has undergone one of those severe displacements in space resulting in a transition to the British Isles. Can anyone at the college tell me how to induce recalcitrant intestines to bear up under the undulatory movements of a ship? Mine virtually sceded (that word looks wrong) from their union with my other organs. Your letter was magnificent.
