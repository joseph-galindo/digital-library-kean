U.S. ARMY AIR CORPS
MAXWELL FIELD, ALA.

Saturday Night

My Dear Miss Thompson:

I finally received the "Service Men's News" and the envelope looks as if its been through the European War Front. More addresses on it than I have ever seen put on any stationary.

First of all I must tell you that I put in for a transfer into the Air Corps. That finally came through about the 1[st] of March. From Ft. Monmouth, I was sent to Pa., and from there to Nashville, taking tests, physical training and so forth. From there I was sent here to Maxwell Field, to start my Pre-Flight School. I have just about 3 more wks. before I go into Primary. Spend 9 weeks there at what air base I don't know. Somewhere though.

The weather down here really is terribly hot. Wish I was back up North again so I could cool myself in the Atlantic Ocean, that's by going swimming. 

Since I've been down ere, I have had onlt one open post night. You being an under classmen, you don't have open post privileges. SO being an upper classmen now why I'll get a chance to go to town quite often now. Montgomery, capital of Alabama is only about 1 mile from us, here at the field. Quite a place.

Nothing more to write about. Please tell Mr. Hess I was asking about him. Also Mrs. Shea, and Miss Acton. And all the rest.

Sincerely yours,

Charles F. DiFazio
Class  -  "39"
