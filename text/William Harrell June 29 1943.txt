Dear Miss Thompson,

Just a note to let you know that all the fellows are doing O.K. except Dick Gruen who is in the hosp. with some sort of sleepy sickness.

We were issued our uniforms and stuff today and also received our injections and it has made our arms as stiff as hell, therefore the scribble.

We had our interviews and tests today also  -  I think I will get the Air Corps  -  I hope!, I made 120 on it, IQ and 139 on the mechanical aptitude test. Louis Dykstra was tops in our group with an I.Q. of 150 and a mech. app of 149, some guy!

Things are going along at a perdy fast clip (someone is shaking the table) and we don't know how long we will be here so if you don't hear from us don't worry.

Sincerely

Bill Harrell

P.S. My address is 

Private William E. Harrell 12134372
Co. C, 1227 R.C., Bbs 8
Fort Dix, N.J.

P.P.S. Don't add this to your collection because it is so messy but I couldn't help it what with my arm and the shaking table.
