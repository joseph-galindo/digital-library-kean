Dear Miss Thompson,

Just a few lines that may be of some help to the request for Lew Fredericks address. These numbers are taken from an accredited navigation program that leaves no time for anything extra.

The latest address is as follows and even if it has changed any mail will be forwarded promptly.

Cpl. Lewis Fredericks
Sqdn 1079
Freeman Field
Seymour, Indiana

Please excuse the terrible penmanship but I'm terribly pressed for time. Graduation is but a very few weeks off and I'm hoping for a long awaited leave after 18 months in the service.

Thank you for the Service Men's News, it provides a much needed link, at least for me.

Sincerely

Donald P. Hoagland
