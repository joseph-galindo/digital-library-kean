Dear Miss Thompson and Everybody:
	I'm going to consolidate a half dozen letters into a few pages of this V mail since most of my news is of general interest.
	First I want to thank all of you for sending the lovely Christmas cards I really enjoyed them.
	If I neglected anyone on cards please forgive me but I just couldn't manage for time.  I had the pleasure of meeting Frank Tomsey a few days ago and we really were happy to see each other  -  Predictably I received a letter from him yesterday saying he is down with appendix.  That surprised me but no need of worry he is recovering fast!  I hope to meet him soon again and am looking forward to it.  (continued) (page break) (new Vmail) 
	Christmas in England was spent in quite an appropriate manner.  We decorated most of our building with holly and wreaths and trimmings.  We had a Christmas Eve dance that was quite a swell affair.  The Red Cross visited us Christmas Day with plenty of candy, smokes reading mitter and also with gifts from home.  They distributed many sweaters and mufflers.  I was lucky to get a sweater sent by the New York Chapter.  We had a big turkey dinner and a movie in the evening.  
	Today we celebrated New Years with another big turkey dinner.  I musn't forget to say we had ice cream on Christmas evening.  Quite a rarity in Britain
