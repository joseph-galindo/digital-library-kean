My dear Miss Thompson:

I have just had my first G.I. haircut  -  now I can throw my hairbrush and comb away.

Last nite Doug Totton, Bubel, and Mercury Flint & myself received our first glimpse of potatoes  -  we hacked up about 500 lbs. of them for a stew. Then we knocked off about 8 cases of eggplant, peeled and sliced them and heaved them into big steam kettles. That kept us occupied until 10 P.M. From 10 until 12 we sliced(sp) (that is the proper word) the decks with brooms & mops. From 12 until 2 we loafed and tanked up on ice tea & fresh roast lamb. Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy for it was the first time since we have been on or closely associated with our dearly beloved uncle we really had all we could eat. (Don't get the idea they starve us here, but when you get 16 hrs a day fresh air & sunshine to say nothing of left-righting or the parade ground that pampered organ that mere civilians call a stomach develops a chronic empty feeling that only supplementary portions of ice cream, pie, and milk that we buy at the service club can assuage. These luxuries we purchase at the service club.)

Well so long & my regards to all. Cheers,

Atterbury

P.S. I managed to escape making my own bed for 15 yrs. but here we do it & (illegible) it; moreover, it has to be a precision (illegible)!!
