FRIDAY

Dear Miss Thompson  -  

An explanation, please!

I've just gotten the latest paper our Alma Mater published dealing with men in the service  -  All very interesting and well organized  -  but  -  no mention of Frank Birkner  -  Is fate so unkind so the holder of Card #1 in your library council has already been forgotten? Shame!!!

So the condition may be remedied in the future  -  my present status is outlined:

Staff = Ordinance Officers School, Aberdeen, Md.
Responsibilities  -  Enlightening field officers (2[nd] Lts. To Generals, honest) in the intricacies of the latest tanks and prime movers.  -  A tremendous education I might add.

(Don't take me seriously as far as the reprimend(sp?) is concerned  -  but my status is accurate)

A few more old grads you might like to know about  -  

Harry Wilson '29  -  Commissioned on May 1[st] here at Aberdeen.
James McDermott  -  Training at non-commissioned officers school and actiong as carpentry instructor also at Aberdeen.

May I hear a word or two when you have a chance?  -  for onld times sake?

Sincerely,

Frank
